TALE OF A HERO By Future Games Official walkthrough by Pavel Cernohous Tol October About playing Tale of Hero in general Left mouse button executes context actions like communicating with NPC collecting objects pulling a lever etc
and exploring objects if nothing of the things mentioned above can be done with them
Right mouse button is used for exploring an object in a scene including characters or objects Olaf would otherwise take
In inventory it is used for exploring inventory objects opening books maps etc
In scenes it makes no difference whether you examine objects with the right or the left mouse button the result is either the same or Olaf gives a more detailed comment of the object if you use the right button
The important information hidden in object comments in scenes will be given if you use either left or right button
Therefore you don't have to explore everything with both buttons Do not forget to examine inventory objects as well comments for them sometimes contain an important hint or information for advancing in the game sometimes you obtain another object in this way e g
opening the bag etc
Pay attention to everything that is happening in a scene
Some hotspots sometimes show only while there is an distinctive change on the screen e g
light in a dark corner in which hotspot is situated
CHAPTER Olaf falls into a cave of a monster he was hired to take care of
His two companions leave him and the only way out of the cave is blocked by a big boulder
examine boulder Olaf notices that the ground beneath him is jagged
take the rope take the leather on the ground
go right and you fill find out what you are against
It will be a tough adversary
Go up to the statue and collect the squash there take one stone from the pile of stones by the lamp take the ladle from the scaffolding go back to the main cave explore the table and take fork from it
You can try to collect the stone bowl as well but it is very heavy and the noise will almost wake the monster
explore the small cage and when Olaf takes a closer look take the leather in the detail uncork the jar with the fork the fork will twist but the cork is out
Inside the jar is wine
you can't take it in the leaking ladle that's why you use knife for the squash to scoop out a provisional jar
use ladle to pour wine into the squash jar notice a strong bar in the cage construction and the structure that holds it
Cut off all four holds Olaf automatically binds them together and you get a strong rope
collect loose bar
go back to the small cage and soften turf under the boulder with wine
The boulder will incline and admit a strange dark cloud which will fly past you into the big cave the den
roll away the boulder completely with the bar escape route is free
Now is the time to deal with the work you were hired to do
go back to the statue a strange creature made of dark smoke will appear the one you let in earlier
Talk to him
go to the small cave and notice the leather on the ceiling Smokey talked about if you don't see it that means you haven't rolled the boulder away completely and there is not enough light in the cave
in one of the conversation topics Smokey carries on in such a way it activates the defense crystal magic above Nog's bed which is supposed to keep Smokey away
talk about it with Smokey and you will find out about the nightmares he used for sucking optimism out of Nog's consciousness which the smart dolsimian then caught in the lamps set around the cave
after the crystals light up notice the ladder next to Nog's bed which could not be seen in the dark
Try to take the ladder but as soon as you come near Nog you will almost wake him up he is a darn light sleeper
talk about it with Smokey
He will explain he could make Nog sleep harder for a brief period of time if you manage to extinguish or at least turn down the crystal he'll help you
about the nightmares and the lamps which catch them you already know
Notice that the nightmares don't fly just around the lamps but around the crystal as well when its on
Cover two lamps you can reach with leather to turn down their light
the last light which sculpture holds in its hand is out of your reach and that's why you have to risk a bit of noise throw a stone at it to break it and the lamp will stop shining
now when the lamps are turned down most of the nightmares will move to the crystal
Hundreds of dark wings will dim its light
tell Smokey about it take the ladder put the ladder to the leather on the ceiling in the small cave and climb to it
tie a string to the twisted fork and stick it in the leather the trap is set it is enough to pull the string and the leather will tear completely
The rest will play automatically Alternative solution the bent boulder can also be rolled away with the rope the cork can also be removed with a knife if you have uncorked the jar with a knife you don't have a twisted fork in the end
Try poking a crack in the rock by the leather in the ceiling where something is glittering you will find only dirt but the fork will bend CHAPTER Night talk to Pripogala in your courtyard go inside and click on the bed Day explore falling door on the floor leading to your pantry

He will tell you he goes to the swamps to get herbs and that he fights the smell with a mask on his face on which he puts perfume from a certain alchemist
continue talking with the tavern owner until you get that perfume recipe from him and until he tells you about the incident when he threw the mask into the well

add charcoal into the jug with water Obtaining artorian apples because neither you nor Masek have heard about Artorian apples before it wouldn't be a bad idea to consult a book about plants
You have one such book at home on your bookshelf where Olaf will automatically find a herbarium
In the herbarium you will read that Artorian apple is just another name for meeshpon and you have meeshpon juice in your pantry
as Alie commanded in her message clean up your house tidy the clothes on the chair the fish net from the other chair and dirty dishes from the table
You will find the key to the pantry use the key to unlock the pantry down in the pantry you will meet an old acquaintance from Nog's cave

How to fish out mask from the well go to your cottage and take fishing rod in casket detail look into the well in front of the tavern if Masekhas told you about the mask in the well already Olaf will notice it and closeup of the well will open use the rod to fish out the mask caught on a dry twig in the well bricks The mask is incredibly dirty though
take the dirty mask to Masek who will promise to wash it
Leave the tavern
For further progress make sure your perfume is ready order of mixing the perfume and fishing out the mask is arbitrary
Go back to the tavern and ask Masek whether he has washed the mask
He will tell you it needs to soak for a while and he will ask you to take lunch to old Mr
Carrot to your own door wherethe grocer will pick it up
collect basket with Carrot's lunch and take it to the bench in front of your cottage go back to the tavern
You will meet Alia with whom you'll have a fight after the fight talk to Masek your mask is washed
put perfume on the mask and you can go to the swamps
Swamps find Pripogala's house enter and talk to her
Pripogala will put magic spell on you which will help you with the swamp smell so you won't have to wear the funny mask any more She will further say you need dead sorcerer's advice on how to defeat Krugell
Luckily one of the reasons for her living just here is the near by source of water of life in one of the ruins of an ancient city swallowed by the swamp
To reach the source you will need a small statue as a key
She prepared it for you on the table
take the statue from the table don't let an angry piece of furniture scare you take the tin by the kettle go out and go right toward the ruin of an ancient building
Thick thorn bush which cannot be cut by a knife is blocking the way though
return home
One of the neighbors has left a flail which they once borrowed from you
take the flail unfortunately it is broken the strap which held the head is torn go down to your pantry and take the old bag hanging on the wall cut off its strap with the knife use the strap to fix the flail use the flail in the swamps to make the way to the building temple with water of Life
Temple with Water of Life above notice the pedestal with a statue on it just like the statue Pripogala gave you
Take a closer look of the pedestal
in pedestal closeup explore the opening there is a mechanism in it which is dirty clean up the opening with oil if you haven't taken it yet it is in the casket just like the sharpening stone was place statue in the opening and turn them by clicking on one of the statues
You will set off a mechanism which will turn into a small lightning from somewhere in the ceiling
Energy will run through the floorand for a while one of the tiles will shine as if something reacting to the energy flow was under it
click on the tile while it is shining
If you accidentally don't make it just make the lighting again by turning the statues
in tile closeup you will notice seams
Use the knife to force the tile out take the crystal under the tile put the crystal into the opening in the middle of the floor turn statues again a path to the staircase leading to the temple opens in the floor Temple with Water of Life down The basin is empty the gargoyles are ugly and a statue of some ancient goddess is greedily reaching for sacrifice
Read the notice on the wall you don't have to but it will give you a rough idea of how things work here
pull the statue's hand a hissing sound will come from a place signaled by a blinking ear icon
while you hear the hissing sound click on it a closeup of panel on the side of the statue stone throne will open the usual tricks don't work with the panel joint around it is too thin to force out
By clicking on the panel you will find out that the openings are loose but there is no handle to grab and take out back in the room take the stone hand on the floor go out and use knife to cut a piece of root from vine on the wall go to the crossroad in the swamps you will find dry resin on one of the trees
Collect it
put resin in the tin go to Pripogala and notice the red hot fire under the kettle
place the tin with resin on red hot stone
after a short while the resin in the tin is melted take it from the stone and take the tin with melted resin go back to the temple to the panel on the side of the statue throne dip the stone hand into melted resin glue the hand to the panel take the hand with the panel interior will show with a leaky pipe it would be good to gag it somehow sharpen vine root with knife dip sharpened piece of root into resin use this root to gag the hole in the pipe pull the statue's hand again this time water will flow from the gargoyles but only shortly and it will immediately flow off through canals
go home and collect the cart wheel in the courtyard use the cart wheel to weigh down the hand so the whole reservoir flows into the basin and the basin stays full use the jug you previously used for meeshpon juice and fill it with Water of Life Alternative solution you can weigh down the hand with the pail from your courtyard filled with water from the swamps you can try to place a vessel in the reservoir and let water fill it
If you place the jug the water will overturn it
If you place the pail well see for yourself but you won't be successful
it is also possible to weigh the hand with a piece of walling which you can pick up in the upper part of the temple or with empty pail but it wont be heavy enough Mykorus the seer go to the place Pripogala marked as Mykorus's grave left from the entrance to the swamps apply Water of Life to earth the seer Mykorus will show up and he's a bit different than you expected
chew the fat with Mykorus but he doesn't want to advise you he wants his peace and quiet go to the crossroads and notice how bringing seer back to life hasn't remained unnoticed by the other inhabitants of the swamp
A slug invasion heading towards Mykoros
go to Mykorus and tell him about the slugs
He will get scared and will promise you anything even work if you protect him from the slugs
Offer him your good old rooster he's great with the vermin
get the rooster from the fence back home and bring him to Mykorus the old warrior is hardly standing though and the Water of Life isn't working its magic this you find out when you try it every magic rule has its exceptions remember you've promised a new job to someone and a Smokey can certainly possess any beast he chooses
Go home to your pantry and tell Smokey about the rooster
He agrees to share one body with the rooster and thus gives him health
return to Mykorus the rooster possessed by Smokey is already kicking and Mykorus can do nothing but keep his part of the deal and give you a prophecy
You will find out that you need a magic object called God's Breath to defeat Krugell which is in a ship wreck at the bottom of the sea
Scale of a white catfish go to talk to Pripogala she will promise to use her contacts in the sea world to find the wreck and open teleport for you there
But to move breathe and speak under water you need scale of White catfish go home and take Bestiary from your bookshelf just click on the books Olaf will find what he's looking for find the page about White catfish you will learn that this fish changes color after death taking color of plain catfish only the white spot on the tail shows what it was while alive
Another important piece of information is that the scale must be given by the fish in order to be magical go to the tavern and explore the trophy catfish above the door you'll find out it has a white spot on the tail and that your father once caught a White catfish and gave it to in keeper Masek talk to Masek whether you can take the catfish
He refuses because an empty space above the door brings bad luck
offer Masek stone hand glued to the panel in exchange for the catfish Olaf introduces his marketing plan how to attract more customers with new decoration and a new name
Masek agrees in the catfish closeup exchange it for the hand go to the temple and use the dead catfish for reservoir with Water of Life After obtaining the magic scale go to Pripogala who will take you to the underwater kingdom
Alternatives if you have previously taken Water of Life in the jug again you don't need to take the catfish to the reservoir it is enough to pour water from the jug on him CHAPTER How to get out of the temple On the right is a gate opened by the panel on the wall you need to insert a key
Explore the back part of the temple indicated with a question mark you will swim up to the shrine click on the window in the statue and in the closeup keep turning to the right until you find a strangely shaped key you will learn something about the history of the temple while doing it use the key for the lock in the gate and swim out of the temple
Finding ship Dragon's Pride swim away from the temple and in the crossroads continue swimming up
From here you can already see the ship wreck in the distance but when you try to come closer ghosts will appear who will not let you pass
return to the crossroads
There is a hidden path among stone formations which will take you between the cliffs
There is a casket which drifted from some singing ship long time ago
further away collect a stone and in casket detail try to break the lock with it
Unfortunately the casket is substantial and the stone is soft so it falls apart in your hands
rather collect the casket as it is go back to the temple and notice grooves on the floor by the gate the wings of the gate meet here and scratch the floor
Place the casket here
turn the key in the gate lock the heavy gate will close and crush the casket
Examine the remains of the casket and collect a shining object from it it will turn out to be a religious symbol
collect a goblet from the remains as well return to the ghosts and apply religious symbol to any sailor skeleton it is important to use the symbol on a skeleton
It won't work with the ghost
go to the wreck and talk in detail with the ghost of Captain Halden
You will learn lots of useful things especially about sea dragon Mjorgin who stole God's Breath from the deck and disappeared with it in the ditch under the cliff
Have a look at Mjorgin go back to the location haunted by ghosts and go down the ditch on the right
Continue to the cave and look into dragon's den through the natural window
Besides the sleeping monster he will also see God's Breath exhibited on some kind of pedestal in the window of dragon's treasury
Olaf cannot defeat such a monster by brute force
He must try to learn more about him and find his weak point
Cave passage go right from the crossroads this time you will reach a rock barrier overgrown with a sort of underwater creepers use knife to cut one off
Olaf notices that there is an opening behind the creepers
cut through the creepers and an entrance to a cave will emerge
It is dark inside and if you try to continue to the other side towards light Olaf will bump his head against something and come back
explore one of the sailor skeletons the one whose head is in the ship latrine
You will find a piece of spyglass and an old already rusty gauntlet
Take both
Go down the ditch but instead to the cave this time continue to the back towards the location with mirror
He could use the mirror but Olaf realizes that it would be difficult to take it up
Notice the Weird grass by the rock wall
Examine it closely you will find out there is something in it try to get the object out of the strange grass Olaf burns his hand because the grass it is probably some kind of anemone use the gauntlet for the stinging grass take out metal suitcase of the ship doctor right mouse button in inventory on suitcase take out dentist's pliers go back to the temple with the pliers and take a closer look at crystal emitting green light on the right from the altar
In the detail use pliers for crystal take it out return to the cave with the shining crystal which now makes the cave light in future you will be able to walk around here easily
Inhabitants of the cliff Directly on the crossroads there is a strange creature on a piece of rock
take a closer look at it and by gradual excitation of it feet in the right order you will make it spit out a purple nugget she uses for attracting small fish it eats
Before the nugget falls back into the small creature's mouth collect it
with the nugget in the bag go to the cave and try to pass further
A small snake like fish will appear from a hole in the wall and steal your nugget giving you an electric shock
After the cave you arrive to the cliff from which you swim down to a sand wasteland
Here you will first meet whale youngster Nomas
Talk to him in detail especially about Mjorgin and how to defeat him You will find out about sea man Apidulas who fought the dragon many a time and their forces were even
He doesn't know where to look for him Nomas will be glad to help you the dragon has eaten many of his relatives but he has to take care of Minikin a small yellow fish who is afraid of being alone
If you have already explored the mirror at the end of the ditch tell him about it Olaf will suggest to bring the mirror over here so that Minikin can play with it like parrots in cages with mirrors which keep them company All you have to do is think how to get the mirror from the ditch
a bit further talk to Clam
It's so surprised to see you that it gets a spasm and can't open its mouth
after talking to the clam go back one screen and a voice out of nowhere will address you
It turns out to be a small hermit crab resting by the at first imperceptible note growing out of corals
Talk with him he'll ask you for something to eat
Feeding the crab go back to the cave and in one of its parts cut a piece of sea sponge with a knife
use the sponge to gag the opening from which the flashfish appeared earlier
at the crossroads get the nugget from the weird creature by exciting its feet in the right order and feed the crab with it
If you don't gag the hole with the flashfish you'll lose the nugget again
the full crab will be a bit more communicative so talk to him in detail
Raising the mirror from the ditch go around the Clam and the statues stay on the right until you come to the cliff from which you will see a huge field of glowing plants descend and take a look at the big balloon like plant closest to you
It could be used as a real balloon but it must be weighed down with something so it doesn't swim up to the surface once it's cut
go back to the edge of the cliff where the souls of drowned sailors used to haunt and find a heavy bronze kettle
Collect it go down to the statues from them down towards camera and in the ruins of an old building collect a loose stone block tie a piece of creeper to the stem of balloon like plant tie the kettle to the other side of the creeper put the stone block in the kettle now you can cut off the plant and collect the improvised underwater balloon use improvised balloon for the mirror in the ditch take out the stone block from the kettle above mirror take again give the mirror to Nomas Minikin will swim to it and look at himself in it apparently happy to have company
From this moment Nomas is at your disposal to take you where you need to go Curing the Clam Because Crab had lived with the Clam for a while he knows how to cure some of its ailments
He will advise you to catch the flashfish and apply it to Clam
He will also tell you about sea cucumbers by two statues who produce a sticky matter
collect one sea cucumber by the statues use it for the pieces of spyglass you collected by the skeleton in the latrine closeup go to the hole with flashfish
Make sure you don't have the strange creature's nugget with you otherwise you'll get another electric shock therapy
take out the sponge and place the rest of the spyglass glued with the cucumber instead finally get the strange creature's nugget from the crossroads and apply it to the sticky tube flashfish will jump at the treat but the tight tube and the glue will safely imprison it
Collect the resulting quot thunder stick quot
apply imprisoned flashfish to Clam and when you cure her in this way talk to her in great detail
Apidulas Clam will disclose the place where Apidulas lives now
If you've already taken care of Minikin with the mirror it is the right moment to ask Nomas to take you there
goto the tower
The door is locked an no one answers to knocking
go behind the tower and look at the window you can't see through it but when you sit back on the bottom you will scare a small octopus which will swim out of a bunch to behind a big piece of rock
Look there and you will see an object octopus is guarding
She won't listen to reason try it flashfish shock is more likely to hurt you and Olaf doesn't want to hurt her with the knife Thus you need to think of a ruse
try going before the tower and coming back again
You will see that the octopus had returned to the bunch but as soon as you come near it moves to the hollow in the rock in order to protect the unknown object
glue the bunch it returns to with the cucumber leave and come back again
When the octopus moves toward the rock again it will not get there the glue will keep her in place
collect the unknown object it is a strange shell with straps Apply the shell with straps on the door
You will hear Apidulas swearing about octopus losing his ear trumpet again
Olaf realizes he is talking about this shell with straps and that he can't deal with Apidulas before he somehow delivers the ear trumpet to him
go to the opposite side of the tower and swim to the opening in the window
tie the ear trumpet to flashfish it is enough to place ear trumpet on it Olaf will use the straps and push it through the hole in the window gag the hole with the sponge so that flashfish can't swim out place the strange creature's nugget on the crossroads under the tower door and what for what is coming
now that Apidulas has his ear trumpet you can knock on the door again this time he will hear you
talk to Apidulas about everything under the sun the important thing for you now is that he is willing to fight Mjorgin but he needs his jewel to do so
Olaf tells the surprised Apidulas he has met the jewel and will try to find it again
go back to the cliffs with Nomas a surprise is waiting for you here Minikin has disappeared and the mirror as well
Nomas is very unhappy about it and Olaf who feels partly responsible offers to help him of course
ask Clam about Minikin it will tell you about the Blue Starfish a creature capable of finding anything and anyone if it has someone or something who had a relationship with the missing thing or person
Obtaining the Blue Starfish talk to Nomas about Blue Starfish he will tell you the legend according to which the Blue Starfish appears once in a while among green starfish feeding on moss keep asking Nomas until he takes you to the reef with green starfish go inside and walk through the cave to the room where the hall is well lit by shining rods
No visible path further ahead but that is not important considering the fact that Olaf is blinded by the light go out again try to collect interesting stones on the left by the spring they are red hot collect the red hot stones in the goblet you collected from the casket at the beginning of the chapter on the right on the rock is a strange creature click on it and it will spit out a cloud of smoke
You could use such a talent but the creature is holding fast to the rock place red hot stones on the rock around the creature apply them on the creature when the ground beneath its quot feet quot becomes hot it will let go take the creature use the creature against shining rods in the cave hall when the creature releases ink cloud it will shadow the bright light for a moment and on the right an opening in the rock will show it was hidden in the shadow before
Click on it Olaf will get through to the other side follow the light all the way to the beach collect one of the Blue Starfish and return under water and head toward Nomas you will find out the ebb tide has imprisoned you until the morning return to the beach collect another Blue Starfish in the morning go to the sea and all the way to Nomas return to the cliffs with Nomas Looking for Minikin and Apidulas' jewel use Blue Starfish on Nomas the starfish will start showing where Minikin is tell Nomas about it he will take you in front of the cave passage go inside Minikin has hid himself here and seems to be happy go out and tell Nomas about it
It is time to look for Apidulas' jewel go to Clam and use Blue Starfish on it starfish will start showing the direction of jewel get Nomas and get a ride to the jewel in new location go to Place the starfish is showing you will find crab Fenintair Apidulas' jewel
talk to him in detail until you persuade him to go back to Apidulas with you with crab in your bag go to Apidulas deliver crab to Apidulas return to the cliffs Apidulas and Mjorgin are fighting already you can go to Mjorgin's den in the ditch under the wreck Mjorgin's den now you can descend to Mjorgin's den but the path to treasury is blocked by a big turtle with sharp teeth munching on sea weed but you can't really rely on her being a strict vegetarian try to talk to the turtle she speaks so slowly you can't understand her
Remember what Crab said about speed herbs and what they did for Clam go to Clam and cut off some speed herbs from the part of the cliff Clam is sitting on return to the turtle and while she is chewing ad herb to the weed wait until the turtle takes another bite eating some of the speed herb talk to the turtle again this time you'll understand her
You'll find out she is not too bright and you will assure her you are Mjorgin's ally
The distrustful turtle will still want to ask questions to see how well you know Mjorgin
Correct answers are Mjorgin's flag a head with snakes instead of hair the same as on the tablets in the temple What does Mjorgin eat plankton attention this answer will show only if you have explored the mirror in the ditch which has reappeared there after Minikin's disappearance Who was Mjorgin's teacher titan Hedarius you have learned this in conversation with Fenintair if you give correct answers to all questions the turtle will let you through in the back part of the den examine the tablets you will discover a classic slider puzzle which Olaf will solve in an untraditional way click on the tablets in closeup and you'll see for yourself return to the front of the den and collect several gold pieces from one of the junk piles Olaf will take return to the broken slider and place one gold object to every sprig to weigh them down take away a piece in the upper left corner of the broken slider and discover a button press the button if all the sprigs are weighed down a glass gate to the treasury will open and you will get inside in the treasury explore the pedestal on which God's Breath should be

Village explore the house on the left with smoke coming out
In door closeup try yo knock no one will open
Notice an opening for a knob or a key
collect the shovel in the village on the right under the path up to the house out of big scull is a snow bulge
Use shovel to remove snow you will discover a bone manger take a closer look at the manger especially the bottom with some crust
By examining the bottom Olaf discovers it is salt use knife to scratch salt crust on a pile and collect it to the right are two big bone notices
Explore the left one there is something in the opening on the lower edge
Collect it you will find out it is some sort of lamp with no fuel go towards the crack and notice the ship wreck on the right and particularly the lever
You will need it but you cannot collect it at the moment it is frozen to the rock
continue toward the crack in the iceberg and you will reach a stone door
Left to the door is a crow which is frozen
You don't have fire Pripogala's potion is only for living creatures use salt to melt the ice on the crow
in crow closeup move it to position which opens the door
walk through the door to another room and notice the small door in the back wall
Take a closer look in small door closeup turn the knob and open the door it is a sort of elevator like the ones used in castle kitchens to send food and drinks from the kitchen to the dining room when the little door is open notice the pin which is holding the knob
Take the pin and close the door again take the knob from the small door
notice the empty opening on the right side of the door something is missing in it go back to the village and using the knob from elevator door open the door of the smoking hut
Deve's hut Take a good look inside the hut
talk to the Deve lying on the bed if she is thirsty if she wants a drink
collect a bowl from another bed cut off a piece of fur lying on the bed on the right explore two objects on the left the stove and the scuttle take a closer look at the scuttle inside is not coal but dry dung
Olaf knows he could use some fuel but refuses to add something that disgusting to other things wrap dry dung in a piece of leather use a piece of leather to scuttle you will gain fuel but not such you can use in the lamp look at the pantry door on the right and open it in the pantry you will cut off a piece of fat from the meat use the fat as lamp fuel you can light the lamp in the stove now go outside the hut and notice the snow collect some snow in the bowl go back to the hut and wait for a moment for the snow in the bowl to melt give bowl with water to the Deve she will drink the water and then spit it out saying she wanted a sip of something harder
She will tell you about brandy she has hidden in the shelter up in the hut from the big scull go outside and try to get to the scull you won't make it tell Deve about it she will tell you about crampons under one of the beds explore all spaces under beds until you find the crampons use crampons for icy path to the scull you will make it with them on your feet In the scull hut there is something like a basket on the floor since it's in your way collect it the secret shelter is in the space behind the stairs just like the Deve said
In closeup draw leather aside push back bone lid
first collect the box with explosive crystals you might need them later you will find the brandy under crystals
Pick it up and take it to the Deve now she'll happily talk to you
chew the fat with the Deve and don't be shy to go back to her several times during the game to share your experience and get new information
Especially ask about the elevator you found behind the stone door if the elevator theme doesn't show with the Deve go and explore it Deve will tell you that you activate it with a lever usually owned by the shaman but she had her own copy made which she hid under one of the bowls in the scull hut
go to the scull hut go up the stairs and you will really find the lever under one of the bowls
go to the elevator and place the lever to the empty slot on the right from elevator door
From this moment you can send the elevator up or down
Door to the maze As Deve has already told you behind the big stone door there is a large maze leading to Krugell's hall
You have maybe realized that the lever by the small stone door has three positions up middle down for some reason it controls the small and the big door the only problem is they cannot be opened at the same time
Unless you found a way to keep the small door from closing notice the wreck of a ship in front of the crack in the iceberg outrigger with a big metal skate is frozen to the stone
use the fuel dry dung on the ice and light it with a burning lamp the ice will melt collect the outrigger go to the small stone door and use the outrigger to support it the door has to be open pull the lever to open the big stone door position all the way up remember it has positions Navigation in the maze Wandering in the maze on your own will get you nowhere you must find someone with better instincts to help you
Hint Talk to the deve about the maze and if there is a map for it
She will tell you the story of Reul which in their language means owl
Equipped with this piece of information go to the scull hut and take a look at the perimeter bone with carvings
Olaf will find an image of an owl and read the story next to it about a tame she bear who brought a young man home in a snow storm because her cubs were there
in the crack on the left is a hole in the wall with eyes blinking
Reach inside there is a cat with kittens but she is not in a good mood go to Deve's hut and explore the vial with aromatic concoction above her head it is fastened to her bed ask Deve about the aromatic concoction it helps her fall asleep but you can take it collect the sleeping concoction take fish or cut a piece of meat in the Deve's pantry season the fish or meatwith sleeping concoction offer this seasoned food to the cat she'll sleep like a baby take the cat and put the kittens in the basket you previously obtained from the scull hut put the kittens in the elevator and sent it up to Krugell use the cat at the beginning of the maze the cat will wake up and run to find her kittens who are now somewhere at Krugell's in the maze follow the cat's footsteps in the snow Krugell's hall You have surprised Krugell in his den with his back turned
Unfortunately it won't be that easy he will throw his cudgel inscribed with runes at you it will be a narrow escape and then he'll continue undisturbed with his previous obviously more interesting activity
try to approach the cudgel barb will appear from the ground look to your right there might be a way around but you'd have to scratch your way up a big ice post take a closer look at the ice post a closeup will open examine the ice fibers Olaf notices that the places where the fibers intersect are weak spots in the ice use the knife to cut openings in all four weak places there are ice is to hard for you to cut out holds for your hands that is why just small openings
use explosive crystals on barb the explosion will not do the whole job but it will blow off some barbs
Olaf collects them and you have ice thorns collect the stone on the floor left in the ice pole closeup use ice thorns to the openings made with knife and use a stone to plant them deeper
Of course it is not plain ice and thus it will hold your weight easily you've created hold to help you climb to gallery climb up to the gallery and explore a possible path around the barb unfortunately the barb is here as well explore the big ice cube and try to throw it it is frozen to the ground explore the cube again a closeup will open
Notice the crevice between the cube and the floor insert explosive crystal here after the explosion the cube is down from the gallery collect the big ice cube and use it for barbs your plan to push your way through will unfortunately fail the barb is really very very hard and they stop the cube the explosive crystals again use it on the cube propped against the barbs and see what happens finally push the cube away from the path and climb the stairs to Krugell Duel with Krugell Not even in this exciting moment you cannot die Pripogala's concoction is protecting you so stay cool and explore the scene hotspots at ease and try out combinations
If you want to leave the duel you can use the same staircase that brought you here exit in the left part of the screen
The duel will continue the next time you enter
Krugell will use his freezing breath against you let him freeze you at least once after you defrost let Krugell know his cool breeze don't impress you much
he will then try even harder and the snow cloud will be much bigger against flying snow the only visible effect of Krugell's effort use God's Breath this will turn the freezing breath against Krugell and you'll freeze his legs
This will earn you some time until Krugell breaks the breath on his feet
notice the big icicles up on the ceiling how noise makes them vibrate when Krugell shouts notice the opening in the ice crystal close to the ground on Krugell's left send God's Breath at it
The hollow crystal will make a loud sound and the icicles will tremble blow into the opening when the stalactites are shaking Krugell is shouting one of the bigger icicles will come off it will miss Krugell but it will make a hole in the icy floor and start a crack at the first chance you get when Krugell's legs are frozen throw explosive crystal into the crack in the floor Freeing princess Erea after defeating giant Krugell go back over the ice gallery come to the room where you will seepetrifiedErea
click on her after a series of automatic events have a detailed talk with Krugell enter through the open mouth of the stone statue and either move the right crow or explore the reflexion on the wall you will find out that Krugell's plan for catching the sorceress will not work because the small door is still blocked with the lever tell Krugell about it he will tell you about a secret shortcut to the village Catching the sorceress take the secret path left from the stairs to ice head to the village and go all the way to the small door remove the lever underneath the door Krugell will close both doors from upstairs and thus catch Pripogala between them
She will start to burn her way out
You mustn't let her succeed use God's Breath on red hot door
You will manage to cool it but not for long
Olaf tries to think of a way to prolong the effect of God's Breath without having to be there himself if he could have a rack in the ice and fasten God's Breath to it place the knife on the red hot door it will become hot too use the red hot knife to cut a hole in the ice in front of the door collect the lever place the lever in the hole in the ice in inventory cut fur into strips use strips to fasten God's Breath to the lever driven into ice you can go to Krugell and talk to him combine the warming potion with explosive crystals go to elevator controls in the mouth of ice statue and try to send the explosive pack down in the elevator you will find out Pripogala blocked it somehow go to Krugell's hall and collect his cudgeon place cudgeon in the elevator ask Krugell to activate the magic barb of the cudgeon go to the elevator in ice head ice barbs from the cudgeon have created a hole in the elevator throw the explosive pack into the hole in the elevator and wait to see what happens go down to the room between the two doors and examine Pripogala's remains collect Vamor knot and go back to Krugell with it have a good talk with Krugell go to the room in which Erea was get the crystal Krugell spoke about leave the room go down the stairs and enjoy the finish

Game Boomers Game Cheats and Walkthroughs for Boomers and the rest of you guys
A Walkthrough by RJ Roman This walkthrough will cover both the Entertainment and Game Players mode of play
These modes will be referred to as ENT and GP in the remainder of this walkthrough
I used Microsoft Word for Windows to write this walkthrough
It can be view in this program or Wordpad
Also I ve created a version of this walkthrough that can be viewed using the MS DOS text editor
A couple of notes before we get started
Follow the natural progression of the game
There are three narrative paths and your decisions determines which type of character Text turns out to be
This walkthrough follows the Lombard Street path
If you want to go down Mission Street or The Boulevard of Broken Dreams read your users guide page to determine what type of character Tex needs to be to venture down these paths
Look at things before you pick them up and examine everything you pick up
Often you will receive a point or two for doing this
In the GP mode you will have either a time limit to solve puzzles or a limited number of moves you can make to solve a puzzle
Always work within these limits to obtain the maximum point value
So if you are playing the GP mode and you want the Max points given for the puzzle you are solving always save your game before you begin to solve the puzzle
That way you can restore your game if didn t quite get it right the first time out
And if you wondering if all the puzzles can be solved within the given time limits the answer is YES
There are many ways to approach the game so I m writing from my own experience
DAY ONE After the cinematic introduction you end up in Tex Murphy s bedroom
You have been hired by Gordon Fitzpatrick to do a job
You need to find Thomas Malloy
You already know a couple of things
You know that Thomas Malloy was staying at the Ritz where you live
So that s where you need to begin your search
Exit Tex s bedroom through the door near the pony
This leads to Tex s office
Go into your inventory and look at the business card Gordon Fitzpatrick gave you
Now you know how to contact him if you have additional questions
By now you have figured out that Tex owes everyone and since Fitzpatrick just gave you dollars it is probably a good idea to pay off your debts
Go to the desk and open the top left drawer
Get the bill from the electronics shop for
Examine it
Pick up the jack knife on the table behind the Tex s desk
Now head for the door to fire escape
Talk to Chelsea
You must get her to agree to go out on a date with you
Now head over to the Ritz and talk to Nilo
Pay Nilo the for your back rent and then question him about Thomas Malloy
Nilo will ask you for an additional dollars for the information so pay him
Nilo will tell you the room Malloy stayed in and that Malloy used a different name while a resident
Now go to Malloy s room and check it out
When you get there you will find out that Nilos put a keyless entry lock on the door and omitted to give you the entry code
Get your money s worth or pay Nilo an additional for the code if you are working on the Mission Street path or you can threaten him for the code if you are working on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams path
It s up to you
Now head back up to Malloy s room
As soon as you enter the room you get knocked out
This takes you to day two
DAY TWO When you wake up search the room
Open the drafting table drawers and get and examine the Acme Warehouse business card the air mail envelope and the photograph
Move the cushion of the chair and get the picture of Malloy and the llama
Open the box shipped from Mexico the only one you can open and get the book entitled Airport of the Gods
Get the scarf from the bed
Get the letter off the nightstand from David Wright and open the drawer and get the pawn shop receipt
Remember Always look first open move or get next and examine
Now you have a few new clues concerning the whereabouts of Malloy
So follow your leads
Leave the room
When you get into the hallway Tex makes a comment about the time and missing Chelsea s date
You might want to drop in on Chelsea and try to make up
However when you arrive you ll find that Chelsea is not home
So get back on the case
You know that Malloy pawned an item at Rooks Pawn Shop
Go there and pay Rook the you owe him
Ask Rook about the photo of Malloy
Don t offer him the pawn receipt
At this point money has to be a real concern so don t redeem the ticket yet
You won t need the pawned item until late in the game anyway and you do have other debts to pay
Exit the Pawn Shop to the street
Head over to the Acme Warehouse
On the way look at the old movie theater
Its been renovated
Look at the marquee
Also on the way you ll see an envelope on the ground in front of the mailbox
It s addressed to an orphanage and it has money in it
Mail it or keep the money
It s up to you and what path you want Tex to take
When you get to the warehouse you ll find it closed
So go David Wright s cabin
When you get to the cabin you ll immediately know that something terrible happened here
Open the draw behind the couch and get the CD
Next get the wad of paper on the floor by the tree
It gives you instructions on how to break the code on the CD to open a keyless entry door upstairs
Go upstairs and move the picture to reveal the keypad
Now head back to Tex s office
While you re there look at the can of dog food on the back desk
Its not important but it will give you a few points
Now head for the computer room and solve the first puzzle
While you re in the computer room pick up the paper with the picture of your old buddy Mac Mulden on it
You ll get a few points
There are a number of ways to solve this puzzle but in case you can t seem to figure it out here is one example Starting with the top left to right like reading WHITE BLUE YELLOW RED RED GREEN WHITE BLUE BLUE YELLOW RED GREEN GREEN WHITE BLUE YELLOW Now read the rest of the information on the CD and head back to the cabin
Open the door using the code
Move the floorboards and find David Wright s body dead as you expected
Replace the floorboards and open the bookcase doors and get the film
Load the film into the projector and watch the movie
After the movie leave the cabin
It s time to find out who the scarf belongs to and explore its connection to your case
Begin by giving Louie a visit
On the way you ll find Nilo s wallet with money in it
You should have remaining so pay Louie the you owe him then ask him about the scarf
He ll tell you about Emily
Then let him take a look at the picture of Malloy
Next let him look at the untranslated letter you got from Malloys room
He won t be able to translate it for you but he ll send you to Clint who he thinks can translate the letter
Also ask him about Luci Luv the name you read on the marquee of the old theater
Leave the Brew n Stew and head for Coit Tower to talk to Clint
Yes he s moved up in the world
On the way you can decide whether or not to return the money to Nilo
If you do while you re in the lobby check out the vending machine and get Nilo s note off the end table
You ll pick up a few points
On your way to Coit Towers read the flyers on both fences
One tells you about Clint and the other tells you about a new character on Chandler Ave Go talk to Clint
Ask or show him the scarf and he ll tell you about Emily and where she works at the Flamingo
Ask him about Luci Luv and he ll tell you that s Emily s stage name
He ll also tell you about Gus Leach and give you a key to the Flamingo Club
Now ask him about the untranslated letter
He won t be able to decipher it for you but it at least makes an attempt
He gave you a key so go follow up the lead
Go to the Flamingo
Open the door with the key Clint gave you
You don t learn much from the visit but at least you find out the Emily does live there
You ll just have to find another way into the club
Hey maybe Chelsea is home now
Go check on her
You missed the date but try to make up with her even if you have to show her the physical evidence of the bump on your head
Ask her out for a drink to the Flamingo and she ll tell you about her new membership to that club
This takes you to day three
DAY THREE After the cinematic scene at the Flamingo go back to your office and examine Emily s note
This is the second puzzle
A jigsaw puzzle
If you are playing in the ENT mode you have all the time in the world
However if you are playing in the GP mode you have a time limit to solve the puzzle
So save the game before you examine the puzzle
By the way the puzzle reads I m watching you
I take pictures
Be afraid
On the bottom of the note is an arrow
After you decipher Emily s note go talk to your buddy Mac Mulden
He ll give you some information on the Black Arrow Killer
Go to the Brew n Stew and ask Louie about the stalkers the Black Arrow Killer and the Bay City Mirror
He direct you to Rook s trash can
Go to the alley behind Rook s Pawnshop
Get the newspaper article about the Black Arrow Killer and learn about the author of the article Lucia Pernell
While you re back there you should notice the manhole cover in the corner by the basketball goal
Remover the cover and enter the sewer
Move one of the boxes and find some money
Also travel further into the sewer and find the only box you can open and get the chisel
When you exit the sewer go into Rooks Pawnshop
Ask Rook about strangers Emily s note the Black Arrow Killer and Lucia Pernell and he ll be good enough to give you a card with her phone number on it
Finally ask Rook about the Yucatan language and he ll sell you a book for that will help you decipher the untranslated letter you got from the cabin
Leave the pawnshop and head over to the Electronic s Shop
It s time to settle that bill
Pay Zack the you owe and look around the shop thoroughly
There are some items you will need there later
Keep the items you see in mind
Now go see Rev
Gary
When you get to the back of the Golden Gate Hotel Rev
Gary will be in the middle of a sermon
After he pauses ask him some questions
He won t help you until you find him a bottle of scotch
Leave the good Rev
When you leave Tex makes comments about where he thinks he can find some scotch
Go to the Slice of Heaven pizza parlor
Open the side door of the Slice of Heaven and go up the stairs
Go to the back and open the only box that can be opened
Get the scotch
On the way out look at the panel behind the trash can
Remove the panel and go out the door
It leads to the alley behind Rook s Pawnshop
It s not really important but you do get a couple of points out of it
Now go back to Gary and give him the bottle of scotch
Ask him about Malloy and he ll give you Malloy s key to the warehouse
Now head for the warehouse
Once inside the warehouse open the chest directly in front of you on the far back wall
Get the peg leg
Next look at the crate by the front door
It has Malloy s name on it but you can t open it until you move it out of its current location
Now go to the back of the warehouse and open up the control box
Turn on the crane then lower the crane
Go back to Malloy s crate and put the peg leg through the hole to secure the crate
Now go back to the control and raise the crate
Go back to the crate and open it
Get the tapestry and the photo of the Plains of Nazca
Also you ll notice something fell out of the crate below
Get the map of Asia that fell below the raised crate
Leave the warehouse and head for your office
Contact Lucia Pernell at the Bay City Mirror
Don t joke around with her be straight forward and get to the point
Set up a meeting with her and watch the cinematic scene
Lucia gives you some vital information
After the cinematic scene you ll be taken back to your office
During the scene you saw someone on the roof of Rusty s Funhouse
Go check it out
When you get to the funhouse you ll find that the police have placed a cop lock on the funhouse door
Go see Mac Mulden
He ll give you the key but not the combination
This is the next puzzle
If you re playing in the ENT mode you have no time limit
However if you re playing in the GP mode you have a time limit
At any rate here s the solution Starting from the top left Remember Mac Mulden told you about a trap door to the roof of the funhouse
Locate the trap door opening mechanism behind bleacher on the floor just below the masks
Move it and enter the concealed area
Move the newspaper on the floor and pick up the doggie do
Its not important but you do get a few points out of it
Now go to the roof
Get the jacket from the cooling unit and examine it
You ll find a torn photo and a cufflink with the initials DH
You ll find out what the initials stand for later
At any rate go to you office and examine the cufflink first then the photo
The photo is the next jigsaw puzzle
As usual you ll have a time limit in the GP mode but none in the ENT mode
Assemble the photo and Tex will comment about needing to analyze the photo more thoroughly
Go to the Electronic Shop and buy the Photo Analyzer
Combine the Photo Analyzer and the photo to get the address of AUTOTEC
You ll find it in the second square from the bottom right side just about the car bumper
Before you go to AUTOTEC contact Lucia Pernell again and ask her about Sandra Collins
She ll give you Sandra s address
Go to Sandra s home and get her resume from the draw by the walk in closet and the AUTOTEC ID badge
It s kind of hard to find
It s on the floor on the back left side of the sewing desk
Now head to AUTOTEC
You arrive in the Lobby of Autotec
Go around to the side and try out the doors
You ll notice another keypad
Go back around to the window and move the sliding glass back
Look at the clipboard
It s just out of your reach
You ll need to find a way to get it so you can get the security code to open the door
Look on the table and get the brush
Look at the back door and get the cord from the blinds
Also look on the floor between the seats by the window and get the Visitor s Pass
Combine the brush and the cord to form a makeshift grapple hook
Use it to get the clipboard
Read the clipboard and get the badge number for ID
The number is
Use the badge on the keypad and open the door
If you are playing in the ENT mode you simply look for Dag Horton s office door and enter
Remember the cufflink with the initial DH However if you are playing in the GP mode when you enter the hallway turn left and rush into the storage room
While in the room get the box of soap from the shelf and the mop
Timing is of the essence here so this might be a good place to save your game
You have a security guard to contend with in this area in the GP mode
Wait until the security guard passes and you hear the door shut
Rush straight down the hall to where you see the bucket and mop the floor
There will be a cinematic scene of Tex mopping the floor
When it s over open the door beside the bucket to trigger the alarm then rush back into the storage room and close the door behind you
When the guard makes his rounds again he ll slip fall and be knocked out unconscious
In the next cinematic scene Tex will drag his body in the closet and lock him in with the mop handle
Now you can enter Dag Horton s office
Once inside Dag Horton s office look at the photograph on the wall
It is a picture of Dag Horton
Now you know what he looks like
Open the CD player and get the file cabinet key
Move the book on the desk and get the post it not with Rev
Gary name on it
Umm How does Crazy Gary fit into all of this
Next open the bottom drawer and get necklace that belongs to Sandra Collins
Looks like we ve found our Black Arrow Killer
Now open the file cabinet on the right side and get the photos
Before you leave the room look on the bookcase and get the Meister lock key
It opens the lock to the water tower on the roof of Rusty s Funhouse
Leave Autotec
Go back to the office and examine the things you got from Autotec
Go back to the alley behind the Golden Gate Hotel and talk to Gary Lee
Ask him about Dag Horton and the roof of Rusty s funhouse
He ll tell you he just saw someone go up there only moments ago
Return to the roof of Rusty s Funhouse and use the Meister lock key to open the lock on the water tower
Look through the binoculars on your left hand side and a cinematic scene begins where the Black Arrow Killer is making an attempt on Emily s life
Depending on how you ve played the game so far you ll save Emily or she ll be killed by the Black Arrow Killer
Let s hope you get there in time to save her
After the cinematic scene you ll be back on Chandler Street
You must locate the Black Arrow Killer before he leaves the neighborhood
Rush over to Rook s Pawnshop and ask him if he s seen the killer
He ll tell you he did and that he heard someone on the roof
Return to the roof of Rusty s Funhouse follow these instructions
The timing here and sequence of events are critical or else Murphy s toast
Watch Dag Horton
When he turns away from you rush over to the stairs and onto the next rooftop and immediately duck down and hide behind the air conditioning unit
Now inch up until you can see Dag Horton
When he turns and holds his arm up to look at his watch run over to the next roof
If you are successful a cinematic fight scene will begin between Tex and Dag Horton Pay attention to the fight scene
You ll notice that Dag drops something
If you are unsuccessful Murphy gets killed
Let s hope you re successful
By the way if you make it successfully to the air conditioning unit you can save the game there and wait for the right time to rush up on Dag Horton
DAY FOUR After the cinematic scene is over return to the roof and retrieve the item Dag Horton dropped
It s a tracking device
Examine the tracking device
Leave the roof and go down to Chandler Ave
Examine the tracking device again to locate the object it s tracking
Walk through the gate beside Rook s Pawnshop and go through the gate
Walk to the manhole cover and enter the sewer
Follow the sewer line around into the next section
In the second section of this area there is a lose block
Use the chisel to open the block
You ll find Emily s Puzzle box hidden behind the block
Look at the box first and you ll find out that Dag attached an explosive device to the box
You have to deactivate the device before you can take the box
This is the next puzzle and here is the solution Once again if you re playing in the ENT mode you have no restrictions but if you re playing in the GP mode you have to achieve deactivation in the fewest amount of moves
If you re playing in the GP mode this represents the fewest amount of moves
Load Red Photons Light Red Powercell into the shuttle and send
Load Green Photons Light Green Powercell into the shuttle and send
Load Red Photon Green Powercell into the shuttle and send
Load Green Photon Red Powercell into the shuttle and send
Load Green Photons Red Powercell into the shuttle and send
Load Red Photons Green Powercell into the shuttle and send
After you deactivate the mine retrieve Emily s Puzzle box and examine it
You ll notice that it has holes on the top
Remember this
Now go to the Flamingo and visit Emily
Ask Emily about Malloy the puzzle box and the NSA
Then question Gus
He ll tell you where to find the wrapper Malloy used to send the box
Go into the alley behind Flamingo and look up on the light pole
You ll see the wrapper
Look in the trash can beside the door and get the antenna
Examine the antenna and use it to get the wrapper
Examine the postage wrapper
Tex makes a comment about examining the wrapper closer
Combine the wrapper and the photo analyzer
Search the lower left quadrant and find the postage meter stamp
Go back to Tex s office
You ll be arrested by the NSA
Meet psycho Jackson Cross
You must be pretty straightforward with Cross or he ll be more than happy to blow Murphy s head off
If you live past the third or fourth response you re on the right track
However I got killed a few times before I caught on as to how to respond to Cross
Anyway these are the responses that kept me alive B B C C A C A
The most important thing to remember at this juncture is only tell Cross part of the story then pretend you ve come clean and finally DO I repeat DO let Cross in on the box
Then give him the box
You ll retrieve it later
After the NSA agent literally drops you off at you office meet Reagan Madsen up close and personal in the next cinematic scene
After your brief introduction examine the note she gives you to obtain her phone number
Go back to your buddy Mac Mulden s office and ask him about the postage meter stamp
He ll send you to the post office where a bum will direct you to the Garden House where Malloy is residing
Talk to the elderly lady and tell her a little white lie then be patient and agreeable with her and she ll let you into Malloy s room
Once inside get the book of Bay City News Anagrams off the nightstand
Open the desk and get the Cosmic Connection magazine the Everlok Safe business card and the envelop containing the CD
Examine these items
Check out the closet door
You cannot open it right now you ll have to find the key or get it from Malloy if you can find him
Leave the Garden House and return to the office
Go to the computer room and access the CD you found at the Garden House
It needs a code
You don t have it yet so go back to the Garden House for any new developments
When you arrive back at the Garden House look at the chair
You ll find that Malloy has been in and that means he is alive
Get the jeans from the chair and examine them
They will lead you to the Waterfront Warehouse
Go to the warehouse and meet Dr Thomas Malloy
When you arrive sit back and watch the cinematic scene
You finally have something to report to your employer
DAY FIVE After the cinematic scene retrieve the fax from Lucia Pernell and view the message from Chelsea on your vidphone
Then return to the warehouse and check out the aftermath
Move the box directly in front of you and get the post office receipt
Get scrap of yellow paper off the table and the flight schedule from under the table
Examine these items
Each of them are very vital to your task at hand
Now go to the corner and move the pallets
A safe
Those NSA boys didn t find everything did they
Now in the ENT mode there is an item at the Electronic s Shop that can assist you in cracking the safe
So if you playing in this mode leave the warehouse and go to the Electronic s Shop and buy the Robco Safebuster
It will reveal the combination but not in the correct order
If you re playing in the GP mode you have no such luxury
However if you look at the Everlok Safe business card you ll not only figure out the combination you ll also have the correct order
No it s not a phone number Have you figured it out yet
All of the numbers are squared
If you figure out the square roots you ll have the combination
The combination and correct order is for both modes of play
Open the safe and get the scratch paper and the key
Examine these items
The scratch paper describes a containment unit and the key opens the closet back at the Garden House
Now go back to the Garden House
Get the briefcase from the top shelf and examine it
Inside get the Gate of the Sun photograph and Malloy s notebook
Look on the floor of the closet and get the book entitled Messages From Outer Space
Now head for the office
When you get to the office call Reagan Madsen and set up a meeting
Go to the Imperial Lounge and break the bad news to Reagan about her father
Watch the cinematic scene and after it s over return to your office
Receive the message from Lucia Pernell
Return her call
She has a little favor to ask of you
Ask her about anagrams JI Thelwitt and the Cosmic Connection then end the conversation
After you hang up Reagan will call and give you some vital information
Examine Reagan s Puzzle Box then combine it with Malloy s Tapestry
This is the next puzzle
Position the tiles on the puzzle to match the tapestry
GP mode players you don t have much time to achieve this so get moving fast
I moved more than one piece at a time and that s how I beat the time limit and obtained the maximum amount of points
Now go to Mac Mulden s office
Ask him about the Dag Horton Autotec connection
He ll send you to the morgue where Dag Horton s body is on ice
Get the scalpel off the medical gurney
Go to the drawer marked G H and open it
It s locked so pick it with the scalpel
Go into movement mode and press the shift key to raise Tex above the drawer
Press the D key to give Tex a downward aim
Now look in the drawer and get Dag Horton s wallet and file cabinet key
Examine the wallet and find his security system card
Now go to Autotec
This time the building is empty
GP mode players you don t have to worry about security this time
Go into Dag Horton s office
Use the file cabinet key to unlock the file cabinet and get the documents in the vanilla envelope and the NSA Key
Examine the documents
Remember the access number
You ll need it in the Evidence Room
Now go to the Evidence Room
Use Horton s security system card and enter the access number listed on the card
The number is
Go to locker B and open it
If you need some cash get it
Now go to locker B and unlock it with Horton s NSA Key
Retrieve Emily s Puzzle Box
Next go to locker E and get Pernell s Euphoria Disk
Finally go to locker E and get the NSA ID badge
Now go over to the degaussing machine
Put the puzzle box disk and money if you got it in the machine one at a time
Enter Horton s code after each item then open the cover to retrieve the item
It would be a good idea to lower Tex down so you can enter the number and see the keys clearly
To lower Tex in the movement mode press the CNTL key
Once you have all the appropriate items degaussed you can leave out of the Evidence Room door without setting off an alarm
Now head back to Tex s office
On the way back stop by the pawnshop and redeem Malloy s pawn receipt and get the Black Dagger
Once you get back to the office examine Emily s puzzle box
I wouldn t wish this puzzle on anyone
It almost made me quit the game
It is particularly difficult because the box does not line up with the map
At any rate the first thing you need to do is combine the flight schedule with the map of Asia
Then combine them with the box
Now combine the pegs from Regan s box with Emily s box
ENT mode players be happy you are not playing in the GP mode on this puzzle
GP mode players you have an exact amount of balls to work with
If you get them correct the first time in the minimum number of moves you get the full value of the puzzle
Therefore after you ve merged all the items and before you examine the box save your game
My guide is correct
However you can mess up and place the wrong ball first
Look on the map and find out where the first point is located
The key to this puzzle is that all the points must intersect to form a final destination in the center of the map on the box
Here s a screenshot
Follow it and you should have no problem with this puzzle
I know you can thank me later
Examine the unlocked puzzle box
Now call Fitzpatrick on the vidphone
Ask him about AE OE EW
He ll tell you about Archie Ellis
Also ask him about JI Thelwitt Cosmic Connection and Elijah Witt then end conversation
When you hang up you ll realize that you didn t get the phone number from Fitzpatrick
Don t sweat it it s in the yellow pages
Before you contact Archie Ellis go into your inventory and refresh you memory
Examine the photo of the Gate of the Sun and the photo of the Plain of Nazca
Also don t forget the name Elijah Witt
Now contact Archie Ellis
You must answer his three questions correctly before he will agree to meet with you
Get ready to go to Roswell
DAY SIX In route to Roswell Tex voices some concerns to himself about the safety of Archie Ellis
He is correct
If he does not go back and warn Ellis psycho Jackson Cross is going to have him for lunch
So as soon as you get to the Roswell facility turn around and go back to Cosmic Connection and warn Archie Ellis
Once you ve warned Ellis proceed to Roswell
You will begin in the Guard Hall
Get the paper punches from the trash can if you are playing in GP mode
Don t worry about it if you are playing in ENT mode because they are not there
This is another jigsaw like puzzle
GP mode players you have seconds to assemble the paper to form the number
Now open the desk drawer and get the walkie talkie
Examine the walkie talkie and get the batteries
Go to the chair by the door and get the Emergency Procedures handbook the matchbox from the night stand the Roswell Security Card from the night stand drawer the laser field diagram from under the mattress and the Roswell padlock key from the locker on the right
Also try to open the door to the left of the lockers
Exit the Guard Hall through the door by the chair where you got the Emergency Procedures handbook
Get the shovel by the locked shed
Next look at the boxes by the lock shed and get the fuse
Move the boxes by the Guard Hall and look at the broken cable
Use the Roswell padlock key to open the shed in front of you
Get the flashlight and the toolbox
Examine the flashlight and combine the batteries with the flashlight
Examine the toolbox and get the wire strippers
Now head for the Laser Field Room door
ENT mode players use the Roswell Security Card on the door
GP mode players use the Roswell Security Card then punch in the security code you got from the paper punches
Check out the laser field
Go to the panel on the far wall and look at the laser field security keypad
If you have to reread the laser field diagram paper you got in the Guard Hall
You have to connect the nine boxes in only four moves
Never fear it can be done
Activate the keypad per the instructions
Enter ALPHA
However if you can t figure it out here s the solution
This disables a portions of the laser field so that you can proceed to the other side
You will notice that portions of the laser fields are now blue
That s the portion you can safely pass through
Proceed through the field and get the cable
Also try to open the Main Complex door ahead
You can t right
You ll need to do something else to get that baby opened
Return to the broken cable in the yard outside of the Guard Hall
Strip the cable and use the stripped wire to repair the broken cable
Now go to the door and look at the large ON OFF switch
Turn the switch on and go back into the Guard Hall
Go back to the door you could not open and open it
Open the trap door on the floor and get the box of dynamite
Examine the box of dynamite
Combine the dynamite and the fuse
Leave the Guard Hall
Reenter the Laser Field Room and go back through the laser field
Combine the matches and the dynamite and use it on the door
Do not mess around
You must get out before the dynamite blows almost all the way to the Guard House to survive the explosion
You ll know if you succeed
It might be advisable to save your game before you light use the dynamite on the door
I tried to get as close as I could to the laser field before using the dynamite on the door
That allowed me enough time to clear the building and get to the Guard Hall before the explosion
After the explosion return to the Main Complex door and enter
When you enter the Main Complex the game takes you through the next cinematic scene
Tex passes out as he passes through a gas pocket
Now if you saved Archie Ellis you simply start another day
However if you failed to save Archie you watch as psycho Jackson Cross blows his brains out
DAY SEVEN Tex wakes up in the hallway of the Main Complex
Now IT IS CRITICAL that you follow these instructions to the letter
Don t screw around in this area at first
There is something in here an alien entity that has completely slaughtered every living breathing thing
And IT S COMING AFTER YOU
You must contain it before you can leisurely walk around
As soon as you enter turn left and run press R in the movement mode around the corner and down the passage to the Mess Hall on your left
Go to the kitchen area
Open the freezer of the first refrigerator and get the ice pick
Next open the second cabinet from the right and get the pot
Now rush to the door and exit the Mess Hall
After you get back in the hallway outside the Mess Hall turn right and go back around the corner to the first opening
Open Storage door
Use the pick on the half full fuel drum and the pot to scoop of the fuel
Exit the Storage area
Now go to the Dormitory down the hall from Storage
Use the shovel on the door
Open the door and go through the open doors on the right side
Open the last large cabinet door on the right side near the next open door and get the containment unit
Combine the containment scrap of paper with the containment unit
Leave the Dormitory
Go back to the Mess Hall right turn at the end of the corridor
Go back into the kitchen and turn on the closest front burner near the cabinet where you got the pot
Put the pot on the burner and heat the fuel
Leave the Mess Hall and go left to the Storage Room on the left side of the corridor
Get the box on the shelf on the and examine it
Get the spark plug
Leave Storage Room
Go left down the hall and go into the Generator Room
Open the both access panels and put the replace the missing spark plug
Next open the fuel cap and add the pot of fuel
Go to the right side of the generator and pump or pull the handle three times and turn on the generator
Wait until the sound of the generator diminishes in fact Tex makes a comment about not hearing the generator anymore and use the containment unit on the alien entity
Now you can relax
You can also use your the travel feature now
Begin by going to the back of the Generator Room and retrieving the wire cutters from the top of the box
Also get the oxygen tank
Travel back to Storage Room and get the plastic contain on the box directly in front of the door
Examine it and get the acetylene torch tip
Now travel back to Storage Room for the acetylene torch handle
Next travel back to the dorm and get the CD off the floor
Then go to the back into the area where you got the containment unit and get the CD Player and duct tape from the cabinet drawers
Combine the CD and the CD Player
Now go through the far back doors to the jammed but partly opened door
Look on the floor for another Roswell Level Security Badge
It is just out of your reach
You are going to have to get something else to retrieve it
Finally travel back to the Mail Hallway
Open the Rec Room door
Get the Alien Abductor from the table to the left
Go to the free weight area and get the weight bar
Next go to the pool tables on the right and get the pool cue
Finally get the dart off the dart board

Use the Roswell Level Security Card to enter the War Room
Get the alien photographs off the table on your right
Play the projector
Look on the floor by the projector in front of the screen and get the remote control unit for the alien abductor
Now go to the table by the podium and get the Eyes Only Military documents
Travel back to the Main Hallway of the first floor by the door you entered initially
Go into the unmarked room at the end of the hallway
You are going to use the Alien Abductor to enter the rooms on level that you could not enter due to toxic levels of whatever
But your abductor does not have batteries
You couldn t have known
Exit back to the laser field area
NO you don t have to reenter the laser field
You can travel from here now that you ve destroyed the alien entity
Travel to the Electronics Shop and purchase the Robco battery pack
Go back to Roswell and combine the batteries with the abductor and with the remote control unit
Go back to the fan room and use the weight bar on the fan
Use the abductor on the opening in the fan
Once in the air duct locate J
Turn right and take the arrow to the second floor
If you are unsure about the operation of the abductor press F for details
On J locate the following rooms J Computer Lab Go left around the chair and pick up the screwdriver on the floor
Now leave the lab
J Metallurgy Lab Turn right and get the hose from the wall
Leave the Lab
J Linguistics Lab Raise the abductor above the height of the table
Go right and locate the Roswell Security Badge on the table
Leave the lab
If you are an ENT mode player you can press home now and leave the air duct
However if you are a GP mode player you must continue to the Bio Lab
J Bio Lab Raise the abductor above the height of the table
Go to the table to right and get the vial of acid
Now you can send the abductor home
Go back to Level
Check out the Toxic Waste Disposal left of the elevator
Now go around the hall to the elevator for the d floor
Use the Roswell Security ID on the keypad
Enter the elevator
Look at the access panel
See the wires hanging out
That means BOMB
Use the screwdriver to open the panel
Save your game
Use the wire cutters to cut the wire and quickly snatch the bomb out of the panel
Run to the Toxic Waste Disposal open it and drop it in
Then get as far away from it as you can
Now that you ve disposed of the C explosive go check out Level Three
This is the stuff Science Fiction is made of
Check out the alien vessel
Stripped but a vessel no less
Go left and open the Miscellaneous Storage door
Get the striker hanging down to your right and go behind the shelf and get the acetylene tank
Now go to the door labeled
Tex let s you know that this is probably where Item is being stored
Combine the acetylene tip and handle
Now combine the hose with the oxygen tank
Now combine with the hose and oxygen tank with the acetylene tank and finally with the tip and handle
Now combine the striker with the Acetylene Kit
Use the Acetylene Kit on the door
Go inside the room
Look at the computer
Review the scrap paper
Enter the and AC for the access code
This is the next puzzle
You have to create a path for by moving around the pieces
Here is the solution all the way right AND YOU RE OUT OF THERE Now in the ENT mode open the door and get Fuel Cell
GP mode players use the acid on the door lock to open then get Fuel Cell
Travel back to Level Main Hallway
Exit Roswell and travel back to Murphy s office
DAY EIGHT When you get up the next morning you ll have a couple of facts waiting for you
One will be from your buddy Archie Ellis thanking you for saving his life
The other will be from Lucia Pernell
Return her call and get the anagram fax listing
Go to your office and enter the code MERGE THE FOUR CASES TO SEE MAPS
Read the message to WITT
Now that you have his phone number get on the vidphone and give him a call
This guy is really a recluse
He won t cooperate unless you find right line of questioning
You need his address because you know he has something you want
Go to the Electronics Shop and look at the Robco Call Tracer
Ask Zack about it and then purchase it
Now get back on the vidphone and give it another try
This time follow this line of questioning B A B C C C C Since you ve got him to cooperate get him to agree to a meeting
Now go to Witt s apartment
As soon as you enter the alarm goes off
Your first order of business is deactivating this alarm system
First locate the mask and move it and press the pink switch
Next go to the table move the plant and press the green button
Go to the fireplace and look at the orange switch
It s out of your reach so grab the bamboo and take the lifter up to the second floor
Use the bamboo on the orange switch
Finally move the plant aside of the dresser and push the blue switch
That should take care of the alarm system
Get the note on the bed
It gives you instructions to open the box he has hidden somewhere in the house
Open the dresser drawer below the blue alarm switch and get the photo album
Examine it and get the picture
It has some very important numbers on it so write it down
It helps you to solve a puzzle in the house later
If you are playing in the ENT mode there are four numbers
In the GP mode there are six numbers
Use the bamboo to get the plaque over the door and examine it
It gives you the answer to a puzzle later in the game
Get the tweezers from on top of the night stand and go downstairs
Move the plant near the fireplace to reveal a switch that turns of the fire in the fireplace
Use the tweezers to get the foil pack in the fireplace
Examine it and get the key
Go by the table and get the book on the floor
Examine it
Also pickup the book leaning against the sofa and read it
Now look at the statue
Use the key to reveal the next puzzle
ENT mode players have fun
GP mode players you have a time limit
If you read the book you should be able to decipher the Mayan number system
Use the number from the back of the photography as the key
Move the pieces in the same order as the numbers
When you have solved the puzzle it activates the bookshelf lock
Go inside and get the box
Examine the box
Remember the note you picked up off of Witt s bed and the books on the Mayan number system and calendar
There s your answer
This was one of the most difficult puzzles in the game for me because the note and the book did not make much sense
It almost could not make the correlation
I even researched Mayan calendars and it did not quite conform to it
Anyway after much debate trial and tribulation here are the solution I give these willingly because I don t want anyone to go through the trouble I had to go through to obtain a solution to a game that s supposed to be entertaining
Who knows we may all be over analyzing the situation
SEPT AHAU MAY CHUEN APRIL MULUC JULY MEN Leave Witt s apartment and go to the Garden House
Get the package off the bed and examine
Decipher the letter
Now examine the box
This puzzle is easy
Combine the pieces from Witt s box with the final box
Simply arrange the pieces to create a frame around the Mayan symbols
GP mode players you of course have a time limit
The pieces snap into place so it shouldn t be that difficult
Look at the design carefully
Notice anything
There are lighter and darker shades
Place the lighter shades around the upper right portion and the darker pieces around the lower left portion of the design
GP mode players your time limit is very short so I suggest you save the game before attempting to solve this puzzle
Don t waste time trying to place the pieces perfectly
Just make sure it s the right piece and it snaps in that place
The game is very lenient with the placement
I ll give you the placement of a piece to start you off the dark brown symbol that s shaped like a C goes into the bottom left corner
After you ve completed the frame examine the box to get the powercell and the fourth part of the Pandora Device
Combine the pieces to complete the Pandora Device
Now watch the cinematic scene between Tex Fritz Reagan and Witt
After which Reagan attempts to seduce Tex
It s up to you how you want Tex to respond
DAY NINE After the cinematic scene you arrive in the Snake Chamber
Look around
Pick up jigsaw puzzle pieces
One that you might have a problem finding is on top of the tall monolith you see as you walk into the chamber
Look at the Altar
Get the papyrus
Solve the Map Puzzle
It s relatively simple
All you have to do is assemble the jigsaw puzzle
It actually forms a map for you to use throughout the labyrinth
Later you ll use the papyrus to create the map
As usual ENT mode players have no time limit and GP mode player have a time limit
Exit the Snake Chamber through the door with the star symbol above
GP mode players pay attention to the dots to the left right or below the symbols on the doors
It will be important for you to know their position in a later puzzle
Go to the first intersection and get the charcoal along the way
At the intersection go RIGHT and follow the passage to the END
Go LEFT all the way to the END
Go LEFT LEFT again and look at the dead man
It s Edsen
Poor guy
Get the Prescription Glasses the lantern the gun and the handkerchief
Examine all the items
Leave Edsen
Go back the way you came RIGHTS
Take the first opening on the RIGHT and get the White Dagger
Go back to the intersection
Take a RIGHT and follow to the END
Go RIGHT again
Take the first opening on the RIGHT and follow to the END through RIGHT turns
Get the Small Ceremonial Stone Bowl
Go back the way you came through LEFT s
At the first intersection go RIGHT to the END
Go RIGHT and follow the passage through a RIGHT and LEFT turn
Go RIGHT at the first opening
Follow the passage to the END through LEFT turns
Climb the stairs and look at the skeleton
Use the broken lens on the Hemp Cord wrapped around the skeleton s hand and get the Hemp Cord
Also get the Mayan Spear
Go back the way you came in through RIGHT s LEFT RIGHT LEFT
Go to END and turn LEFT
Reenter the Snake Chamber
Exit out of door with sun symbol above
Follow the passage through a LEFT and RIGHT turn
At intersection go RIGHT LEFT and LEFT
At first opening go RIGHT RIGHT and get the Blunt Hatchet
Go back the way you came and return to the intersection
Go RIGHT
At next opening go RIGHT RIGHT and get the Silver Dagger
Go back the way you came through LEFT s
Go to the END and go RIGHT RIGHT all the way through the long corridor to the END
Go RIGHT and climb the stairs
Look at the door and ENTER the Bird Chamber
Look at the wall and the Stone Altar
This is the next puzzle Sound Stones Puzzle
It is relatively simple
Use the Blunt Hatchet on the crystals in pairs to create the same sound
GP mode players you have to complete this puzzle in the fewest number of moves to receive full value
Here s the solution Exit the Bird Chamber through the door with the star symbol above
ENT mode players you will exit to the corridor
GP mode players you will enter the Fireball Room
GP Mode Players Only The Fireball Room is particularly problematic if you are not paying attention to what you are doing and if you are not moving along as quickly as well as safely as you can
The object is to avoid the oncoming fireballs and try all four doors in order to exit the chamber
You will not be able to leave this chamber unless you try all the doors
I ll describe how I beat this chamber
As soon as you enter this chamber get down low to the ground
Low enough for you to see the ground and the oncoming fire ball
I began by maneuvering from right to left
If you follow this path it is the quickest way to exit the chamber
Once you get to the first door on the far right all you have to do is go straight across to the remaining doors
ENT mode and GP mode players now follow the passage through a LEFT and RIGHT turn and go to the END
Go LEFT to the END
Go LEFT again then RIGHT RIGHT and LEFT
Get the Gold Dagger
Go back the way you came RIGHT LEFT LEFT and RIGHT
Take the first opening and on the RIGHT
Follow the passage through a RIGHT and LEFT turn to the door with the Wasp Symbol
Before you enter the Wasp Chamber if you haven t already combine the handkerchief with the oil from the lantern
Then combine the oily handkerchief with the spear
Now light the spear by combining the matches with the spear and oily handkerchief
Enter the chamber
After Tex s comments to himself about the wasps look to your right at the wasp head about the door
Use the spear on the wasp head
Now look around the chamber
Pay close attention to the Mayan Kings
Note their headgear torso and waist down to the shoes
Look at the Altar
This is the next puzzle
It s pretty simple
It is a jigsaw puzzle of the Mayan Kings
GP mode players you have about seconds to complete this puzzle to receive the maximum point value
Exit the Wasp Chamber through the door with the moon symbol above
Go to the intersection and turn RIGHT then LEFT then RIGHT to the END of the passage
Then go RIGHT again and get the Red Dagger
Turn around and go LEFT
At the next opening on the LEFT enter the door to the Dagger Chamber
Look at the Altar and the wall
It tells you the order of the daggers
Now solve the Dagger Puzzle
Here s the solution Note The openings are slightly raised therefore the Black Sun Dagger would be in the highest position
The White Sun Dagger would be in the next highest position and so on
BLACK SUN DAGGER ABOVE WHITE SUN DAGGER WHITE SUN DAGGER ABOVE CIRCLE DAGGER CIRCLE DAGGER ABOVE STAR DAGGER THEN MAN DAGGER Exit the Dagger Chamber through the door with the black sun dagger above
Go to the END and take a RIGHT and a LEFT
Enter the door with the Pentagon symbol
This is Mayan Ascension Chamber
ENT mode players immediately fall through the floor
GP Mode players you have a puzzle to solve before you descend the Dot Puzzle
Remember I told you to pay attention to the position of the dots by each symbol
Well that s what this puzzle is about
You must rotate the symbols so that the dots appear in the correct position relative to the symbols on each of the five doors you have entered thus far
You must move quickly or else the ceiling descends and crushes poor old Tex
Here are the positions and a tip

THE DIG Personal observations amp Walkthrough by Soren Andersen First some words about getting The Dig to play on Windows
It is a pretty old game the Readme which is supposed to contain information that has been issued after the game is published is dated October
It was originally a DOS game but was later configured for early Windows
It does not have an installation program but is played directly from the game disk
I played it on Windows SE by accessing the the game disk using Windows Explorer expanding it and double clicking on DIG MB
The initial menu then appears from which you call a configuration program to set the computer sound card software either automatically or manually and automatic worked with my W
I was also able to play it on Windows XP by using the Compatibility feature but could not configure the XP sound card to work with game software but experimenting with sound card data port IRQ etc
from W automatic selection I was able to manually set the XP so that I could access the game with sound by double clicking on DIG EXE from the game disk
For the record of the choices that were available on the disk the successful ones were Sound Card Sound Blaster Pro Port IRQ DMA Channel Stereo Reverse
More information may be found in Readme files on the game disk
You will find the graphics depicting the characters and many small objects pretty crude by today's standards but that is not a severe drawback and you will probably get used to it after a short period of playing though you will always be aware of it
The settings and the scenery are well rendered in much finer detail
The Dig has an interesting plot and good puzzles though most of course defy realistic physics
The game booklet is very complete regarding interfacing and playing the game read it thoroughly
It has the distinct advantage of having the background music and the sound effects Sfx individually adjustable so that they may be turned down if they interfere with speech the latter happily being completely understandable
In addition you also have a Display Text option
There is much moving around in this game most of it walking and there is no way that I found to make anyone move faster
You can however skip a few of the traveling periods tram movements in particular and move instantaneously from one place to a destination using the Esc key you will have to find where this works by trying it
It is effective for skipping conversations that you have already heard
What I found to be a shortcoming was the sophomoric conversation particularly near the beginning when talking to the shuttle though I somehow suspect that it is not far different from what actually occurs
There is improvement later
You may talk to others at just about any time by clicking on them and bringing up a conversation line a series of image squares showing subjects about which to inquire or discuss
You can continue addressing any of these until exhausted signified by the square acquiring a deep blue cast or by repetition
Quite a bit of information is turned up by using this feature sometimes hints about how to proceed and even setting needed flags
A gray bar below the panel indicates that you may slide it to show more items
The Dig is a fairly linear game and is very much inventory driven
The inventory has more than enough room for the items that are discovered some of which disappear after use
Commander Low appears to carry all of it in his left rear pocket
There are spaces allocated for saved games and the description of the save may contain up to keyboard characters
Saved games are stored in number sequence not name in C Dig
There are many many places to go in this game all of them requiring a visit before the game is concluded many more than once
Other than a few exploratory familiarization visits the accompanying walkthrough is a reasonably efficient one that minimizes unnecessary travel Terminology used is that shown for items as it appears in the game though it might at times be insufficient or seem peculiar and not what I would have chosen
In addition I have provided a nexus diagram to help you keep track of the doorways their trams and spires and the associated control rods
There is a lot of game on only one disk and as always in Adventure games Save Often
Soren Andersen March Cocytus and the Cocytans Beyond the reach of our most powerful telescopes nestled in a sea of stars lies the planet Cocytus as christened by Ludger Brink
Except for one small island surrounded by five spires the planet is completely covered by water
Although this island has a rich and diverse animal population there is no sign of sustained intelligent life
OUT OF LEGEND Centuries ago a traveler from another planet would have found things very different mdash the landmass ocean ratio was far closer to that of Earth and here dwelled the Cocytans a peaceful graceful intelligent race of beings that would remind us of griffins those lion eagle combinations of legend
Indeed considering that the Cocytans mastered faster than light space travel years ago one might question whether our griffin legends were inspired by ancient travelers from this planet
In truth the Cocytans were far more cautious in their approach to interplanetary travel
They sent out probes disguised as asteroids designed attract intelligent spacefaring beings
Cocytan science had progressed more rapidly and in different directions than our own because of an essential physical difference between Cocytans and humans Cocytans had an inherent visceral mdash almost emotional mdash perception of physical forces like gravity inertia and magnetism
This was coupled with mental powers that allowed them to manipulate these forces
Therefore Cocytans went about scientific experimentation much the same way as humans cook or create art by trying different possible combinations until they found the one that felt best or looked right
This process might better be termed tuning or tweaking than experimentation
There was never any question whether a scientific hypothesis would lead to a practical application the Cocytans could sense immediately whether it would work or not only whether a given application would be the most esthetically pleasing expression on that hypothesis
CULTURE AND PERCEPTION The Cocytan culture and belief system would in many ways be totally inexplicable to humans
One exception was their reverence for the number five which was based not on the fact that their hands had five fingers but rather on the fact that the planet's sole mountain of any size was an extinct volcano with a bowl like depression at the top that was surrounded by five rock spires
The mountain and these spires were later hollowed out to house some of the greatest treasures of the Cocytan race including the laboratory and tomb of the Great Inventor about whom we will find out more later
To the Cocytans these places were a combination of Mecca and the Smithsonian
Believing that animal life was sacred they brought samples of every kind of animal on Cocytus to live on this mountain
The more innocuous of these creatures were allowed to roam freely but the more dangerous were confined to reserves guarded by force fields on the mountain's lower reaches
With the passing of the Cocytans the generators confining these creatures broke down and they escaped
Centuries later when the great floods came all the wildlife migrated to the upper reaches of the mountain and found their way into the underground chambers
The Cocytans' reverence for animals was not based exactly on any eco logical philosophy but was instead like their rather tentative attempt at contacting off planet life an outgrowth of their unique sensory perspective
They cannot be said in any real sense to have believed in causality or linear time as we understand it
Their constant perception of so many interacting natural forces coupled with their continuous evaluation of the shifting variables of daily existence would never allow for as simple a conclusion as ldquo A causes B quot If Newton had been a Cocytan when the apple fell he might haves aid something like quot The field of the apple or indeed the field pf any object lesser mass than the Earth has been observed without known exception to have a blue sweet f avored attraction in the direction of the field of the Earth
This attraction is tweakable from factor one to factor five depending on the size of the smaller object the will and expertise of the manipulator the weather and whether or not a cat is present quot Time was considered a relative measurement of the stability of physical forms
Humans for example would have had a time of in comparison to a redwood's time index of
Liquids and gases only possessed time on a molecular and submolecular basis mdash the only levels at which their forms were stable
A COCYTAN TRAGEDY The Cocytan's sensory capabilities add their gift for science were both their blessing and when they turned their thoughts to the problem of immortality their curse
Even though exceptionally long lived by Earth standards the Cocytans knew it could be centuries or even millennia before they would see any results from their probes
This ratio between the stability of their physical forms and the arrival of the information they sought was unacceptable
With this in mind their scientists came up with two solutions each of which though practical in the short term and esthetically pleasing by Cocytan standards had horrific long term consequences
Unfortunately with no concept of either causality or linear time the Cocytans had no tradition of rigorous testing that might have helped them foresee the tragic results of their discoveries
The first solution was the life crystal
Crystals have high stability of form yet because they can be grown they're also unusually susceptible to the kind of mental adjustment that the Cocytans routinely performed
In their research the scientists also discovered that certain crystals conducted energy efficiently and in a manner that the Cocytans found esthetically pleasant
The life crystals they created scanned the DNA of the remains of a dead life form and reconstructed the body based on this information
The crystal then jumpstarted the normal life processes getting the heart pumping and air moving in and out of the lungs
Difficult as it may be to believe that was the easy part
Even the Cocytan inventors were not sure how the other part of the process worked in the same manner that we don't know exactly how gravity or electricity work they theorized that the spirit of a creature retained a certain affinity for its physical form and that when the form was restored to full functionality the spirit was inevitably attracted back to its former shell
The Cocytans were ecstatic at the success of this process for about a week
As more Cocytans were resurrected and hundreds were in those first few days it became clear that the odd behavior of the initial subjects was not a fluke of specific crystals or personalities
Every resurrected Cocytan displayed an obsession with these crystals and a pathological need to acquire more
Cocytans who in their former lives were venerated elders and models of decorum lied stole and even killed to acquire more crystals
Apparently the quot charge quot from the crystals was somewhat temporary
Granted with a life form that was newly dead the resurrection might last or years barring disease or accident
But the longer the individual had been dead before resur rection the less affinity their spirit had for their body and the sooner they would need quot recharging quot The results were tragic to the extreme
As their destructive obsession grew it became clear that all of the resurrected Cocytans would have to be captured and incarcerated or humanely put to death
The emotional toll was incalculable for the hundreds of families who had rejoiced to see their departed relatives returned to them only to be horrified by the sight of their loved ones being hunted down and executed
Unfortunately the crystals were not completely disposed of for it was discovered that their energy when applied to certain devices would make possible other apparently safer means of immortality
Some crystals were hidden away by resurrected Cocytans and never found
The rest were locked in a cache at the base of the museum spire and placed under constant guard
Only the most trusted scientists were allowed access to these crystals
There was even an explosive capable of timed detonation placed in the crystal storage room so that if there were ever an organized attempt to overwhelm the guard and capture the crystals they would be destroyed rather than set loose into Cocytan culture again
THE GREAT INVENTOR Which brings us to a Cocytan revered as no other in his planet's history mdash the Great Inventor
His perception and deft manipulation of natural forces combined with his uncanny brilliance produced hundreds of inventions that enriched and advanced life on Cocytus
When he turned his attention to the problem of immortality no one doubted he would find a solution
He began his studies by focusing on the energy that returned to creatures that were revived by the life crystals
Tracing this energy to its source his findings seemed to confirm the validity of an ancient Cocytan mystical belief mdash that there existed a dimension where the spirits of departed Cocytans lived in eternal bliss observing the actions of the living and advising them through dreams and rare ghostly visits
Once the existence of this parallel dimension was confirmed it was for a Cocytan of the Inventor's talent a relatively easy process to produce a machine powered by life crystals that would open a gate or Eye into that dimension
Disaster first struck when the Great Inventor activated his machine
The vortex created by the establishment of an interdimensional gap sent forces back through the controls that were far too strong for his feeble frame
Within minutes of throwing the switch the Great Inventor was dead
Following a funeral attended by thousands of Cocytans he was interred in a crystal pyramid on the Sacred Mountain
His deeds were carefully preserved in the archives
Soon the entire population of the planet trooped into the Eye secure in the belief that when their probes returned with extraterrestrial visitors they would be able to safely observe these aliens and then return to interact with them
Before they left though in a rare moment of Cocytan foresight they perceived that a technologically clever but ethically ruthless race might find its way to the Eye
To protect themselves and their future they placed particularly ferocious beast in a life preserving stasis field outside the Eye
If a non Cocytan approached the beast would be released to guard the gate
All did not go as planned
The path between dimensions was far too complex for the highly rarefied Cocytan senses and though they reached their destination they were incapable of returning
They could observe and with great collective effort they could manifest an ethereal form that had limited ability to manipulate objects but otherwise they were doomed to eternal existence as bodiless sensationless intelligences
In helpless agony the Cocytans watched as alien races came to their planet and failed to even survive let alone discover how to release them from their imprisonment
Some of these visitors out of frustrated anger spite or their own bizarre cultural dictates disabled some machines or scattered the parts to others
The most crushing blow came with the solar flare that melted their ice caps and flooded the entire planet
Only the top of the Sacred Mountain was spared
Convinced that this was the end of their culture the Cocytans all but gave up hope
And then the expedition from Earth arrived Walkthrough The game begins with an introductory video of a Deep Space tracking station discovering an asteroid on a collision course with Earth the dispatch of a shuttle on an extraordinary mission to divert it using two nuclear devices and a press conference to introduce the crew
All of this is covered in detail on pages and of the game booklet followed by pages of interfacing details which of course you must read thoroughly
You are playing as the crew leader Commander Boston Low and at times this walkthrough will say that Low does something you must do something or just do something all of these being equivalent
After the video gameplay begins with the shuttle parked near Attila the name given to the asteroid and the three crew members that will be going to it waiting outside the open cargo bay
Inventory contains a magnifying glass a crew communicator called a PenUltimate an explosive device arming key and a flashlight
Get the PenUltimate communicator from inventory and click the button on the right to bring up channels to the five crew members
Click on Cora Miles and begin the excessively cute conversation style that continues off and on during the game
A conversation line appears
In this click on the panel showing the flying pig the name given to the free fall tool chest that is in the shuttle cargo bay and Miles will use the shuttle arm to place the chest next to Low
Click on the tool chest whereupon Low followed by the other two crew members will take it to the surface of the asteroid
After it lands on the asteroid surface click on it to have Low go to it and open it click it again for a closeup and remove explosive units alpha and beta the zero G digger and the shovel
The task of the crew is to place and arm the two explosive units
Use the PenUltimate to talk to Borden on the shuttle
Click on the explosive charge in the conversation line and he will tell Low to put explosive unit alpha on a level area in quadrant
Click on a screen area labeled space and you will get an overall view of Attila on which you can find the quadrants
Click on quadrant and when the crew gets there the cursor will identify the target area
Use the zero g digger on this area to make it level then place unit alpha
Use the arming key on it a blinking red light indicates it is armed
Go back in space again
Talk to Borden and he will tell you to put unit beta in quadrant
When they get there Low finds a large rock on the target area which he removes with the shovel
The zero G digger is not needed
Put unit beta on the surface arm it and go to space
Talk to Borden once more and he says return to the shuttle
After the crew is inside the shuttle there a long sequence in which the shuttle moves away and the explosives are set off
Lots of debris none hits the shuttle
The asteroid is not destroyed nor is there any indication of whether it was successfully diverted
The exploration crew is now back on Attila near the top of a chasm that was opened by one of the explosions
They decide to explore the chasm and send the pig on down because it has a light
Geologist Brink says it is a very old chasm but not as old as the asteroid When they get down to the pig they discover in the chasm walls a metallic plate and three ldquo odd projections rdquo
Low pushes on the plate and it falls down a tunnel behind it
He uses the zero G digger on the projections and uncovers plates at each of them
These too fall away when pushed
One of the tunnels is big enough for passage so down they go
They emerge in a huge hollow enclosed by pentagonal sides
On the bottom is a pedestal with the four plates lying around it
The plates may be fitted into a depressed square on the pedestal and when the last of them is in place the plates turn over to form a triangle and things really begin to happen
A long video shows Attila taking off through space and leaving the solar system far behind
As it moves it loses its asteroid shape and acquires sides that are regular pentagons
Its destination is a rock in an endless copper sea the rock is surrounded by five rocky spires and has a center depression into which this geometrically shaped spaceship neatly fits then vanishes
Pay close attention to this vista before it fades away as it figures prominently in the succeeding gameplay
This is the planet Cocytus
The crew is now discussing their situation as they stand next to a black platform ldquo dais rdquo at the center of the depression into which Attila landed
They find that there is gravity and a sustainable atmosphere so they discard their jetpacks and spacesuits
The only things left in inventory are the magnifying glass the PenUltimate flashlight and shovel
Exploration is the order of the day
Use the cursor to find a spot designated clearing and left click
After a prophetic discussion of who is to be in charge the view becomes a large one of the clearing in which are to be found three question marks
Move to the one on the left
This turns out to be an ancient wrecked spaceship
Go inside
After Brink looks around have Low open the trunk on the floor from which he gets a blue item that inventory calls a ldquo device rdquo He pulls down a wire hanging from the roof of the wreck and in so doing causes a lot of animated luminescence to appear swirling around displaying geometric figures then dropping an engraved rod before it departs
Pick up the wire and the rod
Leave the wreck and return to the clearing then go to the question mark on the north
Here they find some mounds in which tusks have been placed and that are home to rodents
One mound is called a grave
Click the shovel on it
Brink seems determined to keep arguing with Low but Low digs it up anyway and gets a jawbone and a tusk
Go to the clearing again and to the final question mark
The cursor shows no hotspots here but the device found in the spacecraft wreck will
Dig where it says and get a bracelet
Back to the clearing view and to the central platform
The swirling luminescence reappears and indicates a small hole in some disturbed ground on the right
Maggie suggests this apparition might be the ghost of a former inhabitant
Low decides to enlarge the hole so click the shovel on it
After a little digging by Low as an archeologist Brink takes over but the soft ground gives way and he falls through
Low and Maggie hurriedly climb down and find that Brink has died in the fall
Low blames himself
Low and Maggie exchange words and she takes off to explore on her own leaving Low to do the same
At least with Low alone you won't have to endure much crew conversation
Low picks up the shovel and prepares to investigate this circular nexus area
The first thing to be found is a plate on the nexus floor near Low
When he picks it up he announces that it is one of the metal plates found when the astronauts first entered the asteroid
Put it in inventory
There are many glowing plants around and when Low touches one they all briefly glow brighter
Continuing his exploration Low will find five sealed stone doors four of which have button panels next to them
Click on any one of these panels to find that the buttons are red crystal pyramids
Click on a pyramid and it morphs to a cube another click and it morphs to an octahedron again and it changes to a sided figure then finally to a sided red crystal
One more click and it is again a pyramid but this time it is green
Continuing the clicking produces the same five geometric shapes after which you get them again this time in blue
A last click and the cycle is complete as a red pyramid appears
Low also discovers a tapered square column in which mysterious smooth grooves have been carved and on the floor next to it a ldquo purple engraved rod quot
Pick up this rod and in inventory examine it with the magnifying glass whereupon the ldquo engraving quot turns out to be four of the above button shapes mysteriously suspended in a line at the end of a purple handle
You must make a careful record of these shapes
One action option you now have is to set the buttons on the four wall panels to this configuration nothing happens but it is not wasted effort
Note Until the rod is placed in inventory the arrangement of the four geometric shapes is random each time you access it so no set can be specified in this walkthrough
Once the rod is in inventory the shape sequence pretty much remains as you read it there but at times it seems to somewhat unaccountably change so it is best to check what it is just before you duplicate the configuration in a door control panel
This of course applies to all rods that you find
There is one opening in the nexus wall that is not sealed off the game calls this a ldquo dark tunnel quot
Click on it and Low gets out his flashlight and proceeds through it eventually coming out on a pathway in a large crystalline area
At the end of the pathway is an airlock though there seems to be no reason for it
At the airlock entrance there are two short columns with blue dots grouped on them
Click on the first and the outer airlock door opens
Move into the airlock and click on the second group of dots and the door closes
Click on it again and the inner door opens
Leave the airlock
The room Low enters is a dome with walls of large windows
He calls it a control room
Click on all the windows on each side of the entrance to get a description of what he sees
Apparently the room is under water
In the center of the room is a shallow pit showing a pedestal on which is a ldquo glowing panel quot
A closeup shows four bright crystals and one dark one all arranged in a circle
Note the similarity to the arrangement of spires that was briefly shown as Attila arrived on this alien planet
There are three empty holes on the right
There is nothing that can be done here at this time but observe so return through the airlock to the nexus
As Low leaves the dark tunnel there is before him a ramp leading down to an area below the nexus where at the bottom of the ramp he finds a rocky ledge overlooking an abyss from which there can be felt heat and heard rumbling
Moving to the edge and looking down he can see a huge pillar extending downward with a cone at the lower end below which is a brilliant energy source with rays going to three points from which they are directed to the pillar
He correctly identifies this operation as the nexus power plant
Low can see however that the ray from the left point does not go to the pillar
Lying just below this point is an object that the cursor identifies as an unattached lens which indicates that repair is needed
A reasonable inference is that the lens must be replaced on the point above it from which it has presumably fallen
On the ledge where Low is standing are two short pillars identified as a ldquo triangular button rdquo and a ldquo control panel rdquo
Clicking on the latter brings up a display on which are seven irregularly shaped panels and a rectangle with serrated vertical edges
Five of the panels produce colored stars within the rectangle one panel deletes a single star and one deletes all the stars
The colors are violet yellow blue green and red and you must associate a color with a panel
Some experimentation is indicated
If you click on the triangular button with no stars showing in the control panel Low complains that nothing happens
Put a star in the panel and click on the triangular button and a football shaped robot drops from a chute above Low goes over the edge and drops to the energy source then moves an incremental distance and finally returns to the chute
The direction of the incremental move mdash up down right left mdash depends upon the color chosen for the star and the number of increments moved depends upon the number of stars
The task then is to select stars so the robot replaces the lens in order to make the energy ray from the left point go to the pillar
Here are a couple of hints the red star is used to pick up and put down the lens once the robot is in the right location and the process is a two step operation pick up and replace
With success in this endeavor Low can look over the edge and report normal operation
Have Low now return up the ramp to the nexus but before he does so have him locate and remove a loose panel on the sloping area
Behind it he will find a quot blue crystal quot a mottled blue cone with yellow metal at the top and bottom Another indication of the return of power is the violet and white energy going up the grooves in the square column
A rock has fallen near where Low found the purple rod breaking the nexus floor and showing sparks
Had you set the buttons on the four wall panels to the configuration of those on the purple rod with the return of power there will be a short cutscene of one of the locked stone doors opening
If you had not preset the wall panel buttons now is the time to do so chances are that you will open the door before you have tried all four
Have Low go through the just opened door and the tunnel behind it to another area below the nexus
On the way there will be a short conversation with Maggie as she calls on the PenUltimate
On the platform is a pyramid with a blue button which when pushed summons a spherical blue tram
The tram door opens for Low to enter after hw does so the tram takes off through one of those underwater passages that Low saw through the control room windows
When it stops he exits to the top of a set of stairs
At the bottom Low finds a ldquo weakened door quot but not weakened enough so that he can open it
Around the corner outside he finds fossil remains in the ground then continues on to steps leading into the water
As he stands there a turtle like creature comes out of the water and begins eating some plants
Immediately a sea monster an eel Low calls it rises from the water eats the turtle and vanishes back into the sea
While standing on the steps Low has seen an underwater cave a fact that he may or may not announce but what he does say is that he is not going to try to swim to the cave while the monster is around
Have Low return to the fossil then through an arch along a path upward to the right
At the end of the path he finds an oddly shaped pillar that the game calls a ldquo strange device quot at the base of which is an oval lens
As Low approaches the pillar another ghost appears circles it and moves rapidly off to the right
Click on the device and a panel appears showing an irregular shaped area containing five circles evenly arranged around a central circle and a pentagonal button next to the area
Press the button and if a line appears from one of outer circles moving toward the center hold the button down until the line reaches the center
If this does not happen back off click on the lens and try again repeat until you do get the line and when this occurs you will find a light beam has been established extending outward from the device in the direction that the ghost went
Low can walk out on this beam and look around that's all he can do at this time but you get a display of the five spires in the endless sea
You can faintly see the light beam forming a bridge extending from the spire with hole in it to a quot crystal form quot above the depression in the large central rock
Click on the crystal form to see it or click on the spire to return to the path
When Low goes through the triangular opening next to the strange device at the end of the path he comes out in an area that he declares is a museum
In the distance can be seen a couple spires and the central rock
There are two glowing green crystals for him to acquire and in the wall next to the entrance a plate that Low seems to think is an alphabet
He can put it in inventory where it may be examined with the magnifying glass and where the alphabet conjecture then seems rather far fetched
Around this area are four openings in walls and pillars that show animated displays containing hints of actions to be performed at times when you come upon relevant situations but the interpretations are rather obscure
View them more than once because Low may have a different comment and keep them in mind including Low rsquo s comments On a ledge another engraved rod may be found a red one this time
Below the ledge is another door and this one leads to Maggie where a not altogether friendly conversation takes place
She says this is a library and the white funnel like objects are computers
The only thing Low can do here is examine the computer console next to Maggie then leave and return to the fossil area
Before you leave the museum save your game so that you can return and review the displays
From the fossil go to the tram which takes Low back to where he boarded it
Go back up to the nexus
Low now has the red engraved rod with a code of crystals to try on the three remaining door opening wall panels
When he finds the one that opens a door and goes down to the tram platform the tram call button that he locates in a column does not work so something further must be done to make it effective
Return to the nexus
Low has no more engraved rods
What to do
He recalls one of the animated displays in the museum in which an oval shaped object was opened like an egg and the contents poured on a bird skeleton which then became fleshed out
Something dead brought to life
As he says it's a shot in the dark but the green crystals he found in the museum are of the same oval shape so try one on Brink
There follows a long scene in which Brink is revived and there is much conversation that includes Maggie on the PenUltimate communicator
Brink says that he is not only alive but ALIVE
Now Low has help with that weakened door he found at the tram terminal that leads to the museum
Have the two board the museum tram and go there the nexus tunnel entrance opened by the purple rod has now been labeled museum tram and together they are able to open the door
Inside they find a large saucer shaped bin of green life crystals and as they are looking at it a ghost appears and swirls around in the bin then briefly displays a deaths head before vanishing upward
There is a long argument about the crystals Brink being very pro crystal and Low advising caution
Both of them take crystals and before leaving Low picks up a canister from the floor
Nothing specific is said about this canister but one of the museum animated displays shows a banded spherical object that bears some resemblance to it being placed inside something where it appears to explode and Low says ldquo that canister sure packs a punch rdquo and ldquo boom rdquo so it probably is explosive
The two go to the steps that lead into the water
Again a turtle comes out of the water and again is devoured by the monster but this time the monster spits the bones out on the shore
Brink disappears and is not to be found
Low calls Maggie then decides he will have to carry on alone
Get a closeup of the spit out bones they must be reassembled and you can use the fossil as a guide
It is not particularly difficult as the bones have finite places where they will rest
Left click on a bone to pick it up right click to rotate it a quarter turn at a time and left click to put it down
Place the rib like parts in the shell then connect the bones to them
The neck and tail bones must be properly oriented
When you have done it correctly the cursor appellation will change from ldquo loose bones rdquo to ldquo dead creature rdquo
Place the canister on the assembled bones then click a life crystal on them and they become animate
The monster emerges eats the reconstituted turtle and sinks back into the water
A geyser indicates its demise
With the monster gone Low can get to the underwater cave he saw earlier
Click on the water and he dives in straight at a rock and swims to the cave
When he climbs out and enters a chamber he finds another panel and an orange engraved rod
That rsquo s all he can get here so he swims back enters the tram and returns to the nexus
Now that Low has another rod he can open another tram door which he does
This tram takes him to the base of large cliffs upon which waves are breaking
There is a long path on the side of the cliffs that takes him to a crevasse up which waves are surging
Put the blue cursor on the far side of the crevasse and when the words ldquo Rumble Rumble rdquo appear left click Low will surf over on a wave
This if you have the Display Text enabled otherwise you will have to guess and if you don rsquo t time it correctly he will go down the crevasse but will eventually appear in the sea swim to shore and return up the path for another attempt
Continuing along the path Low comes to another of the strange devices with a lens at its base you know the drill for him to establish another light bridge
Not much reason to go out on it it rsquo s pretty much the same as when he went out on the first one
Cross the bridge in front of the waterfall into a cave where he will find a blue rod that will doubtless be of use in the future
In the wall is a large crack that Low will have nothing to do with
Return to the strange device
Behind the device is another cave the game calls it a plateau with what appear to be wheels in the middle and an open door at the far end
As soon as Low enters this cave a chirping little rodent runs over to the control panel next to the door removes something and runs away with it whereupon the door closes and locks
Low will have to recover what it was the rodent took so that he can open the door
There are several other items to be found and picked up in this cave a rod a rib cage a metal dowel and a panel cover with a button on it
There is also a heavy metal pole that does not go into inventory but Low rearranges it so an end is between the wheels Low needs to trap the rodent in order to find where it hid the part taken from the switch panel
Put the dowel in the hole in the center of the large wheel click on the pole so that he will pick it up then click the pole image on the dowel to have him rest one end of the pole on it
Click the rib cage on the hook end of the pole and the rod on the rib cage
Low now has a rodent trap
Click on the hole at the base of the wall below the door control panel
When Low says ldquo There rsquo s something moving in there rdquo the rodent runs out and stops between the wheels near the trap
Now you must carefully bring Low around the trap so as not to spook the rodent passing at the near edge of the cave and on toward the entrance then back through the wheels to scare the rodent into the trap
If you are not successful go back to the hole and try again
Recall how the blue tracking device that was found in the wrecked spaceship trunk pointed to the buried bracelet
Put the bracelet on the trapped rodent and click on the trap to turn it loose whereupon it runs through a crack in the wall
Use the shovel to enlarge the crack so that Low can go into the cave behind it
Use the tracking device to point to the spot in the cave floor under which the bracelet wearing rodent is hiding in its nest then use the shovel to dig there
The rodent can be heard squeaking as Low digs
From the nest he can get the ldquo machine part rdquo missing from the door control
Go to the door and put the part in the control
Replace the control cover and press the button to have the door open
The room that Low enters is a planetarium though not so stated but will be soon demonstrated
Here he can get another plate and a green engraved rod
On the wall is a shiny button that appears to do nothing and a crack that has no relevance
On the ceiling is a bright spot that is called a ldquo faint light rdquo
A pedestal holds two scepters one gold and one silver when they go into inventory Low says they have an electrical charge
Save your game here because you may wish to experiment with the somewhat confusing manipulation of the scepters
Click either scepter on the faint light and shortly a blue planet will be seen around which are continuously orbiting a purple and a brown moon while the smaller brown one orbits the larger purple one
Low suggests that ldquo the planet is this one rdquo While there is a bright object just beyond the upper left corner of the screen the faint light
the light illuminating the planet as well as the two moons is coming from the right a little above center
Click the silver scepter on the planet and the moons stop orbiting
By moving the scepter you can drag the smaller moon in its orbit around the larger
Using the gold scepter you can drag the larger moon it its orbit around the planet
In one of the museum animated displays a couple of quarter moons emerge from a hole in a spire and Low says ldquo The larger moon is being eclipsed by the smaller one rdquo and also ldquo Could this be a grave rdquo For someone on the planet you can produce an eclipse of the larger moon if you put both moons between the light source and the planet with the smaller moon in line between the larger one and the planet
When you do this place the larger moon slightly more ccw than you might expect when considering the relative location of the light source
Success is indicated by a brief cutscene showing a path going around a rock on a promontory and in the distance a spire with a hole in it containing two nested quarter moons
After the cutscene ends there is another showing the rodent again taking the part out of the control panel and the door slamming shut
However Low can open it using the button and he can start back to the tram and the nexus
Before leaving the rodent cave it is important that he pick up the rod that he used to make the rodent trap
When Low gets to the crevasse he says that he will never make it across the way he did on the way up
Use the shovel on the large upright boulder on the right and it will fall to provide a bridge and he can return to the tram and the nexus
Back at the nexus a check on the inoperative call button at the tram terminal that the red engraved rod made accessible finds that it still does not summon a tram
Low now has a green engraved rod to open another door and there is only one door left on which to use it but when he tries it does not work
Try again
He speculates that he has set the crystal buttons correctly but that there is no power
The power flow is showing on the square column so it must be a local problem in the panel power to it probably interrupted by the rock that fell and broke open the floor examining the innards of the control might be in order
It so happens that the control cover can be pried off using the tusk Low has been carrying so long and he somehow confirms that no power is reaching the panel
He has also been carrying a wire from the wrecked spacecraft that he now connects between the panel and the sparking break in the nexus floor
Energy can be seen flowing up the wire enough so that the wire disappears but the control becomes operative
When he replaces the control panel cover and presses the buttons the door opens
Down at the tram platform he notices some damage but the call button works and the tram arrives
When he leaves it he enters a brightly lit canyon in which a river is flowing
There is a rock bridge in the foreground and a cave in the distance beyond the tram opening
Upon entering this cave he comes out on a small rocky beach where some green lights are twinkling on a rock a ldquo strange field rdquo the game says
Nothing happens as Low goes to them so it rsquo s back to the canyon and to the rock bridge
Here he enters a sandy floored cave in which is indicated a ldquo nest rdquo on the left and a ldquo pit rdquo on the right
Going to the nest he comes out on the wall of another cave if you look to the left you can see a spider before it disappears
There is a grate in the cave wall below the path the latter taking him to an exit into another part of the canyon
A cave across the river leads to a small blue rock beach on the endless copper sea
Nothing doing here so return and go to the waterfall at the head of the canyon
Here Low finds another grate but when he goes to examine it he steps on a rock that tilts and diverts a stream into the grate
Back to the nest and the sandy entrance cave
Have Low see what the pit amounts to
He goes through another good sized cave to an sunny opening at the far end where he finds an area with a babbling brook and many leafy vines growing
In the center is a mound in which there is a panel of the familiar four crystals
One of the sets from the engraved rods should operate whatever this does
Hint try the red save your game first in case you want to do it again
What results is a quickly fading and none too clear hologram of a place with a black triangle in the floor
Low calls this vision a map
He also says ldquo it looks like a crypt somewhere and a way below it rdquo
Behind Low in the leafy colonnade is an opening and going through it he finds another strange device where he implements the familiar procedure to establish another light bridge the third one
He has been to every location that he can find in this spire so return to the tram and the nexus
Low has gathered items since he was in the control room beyond the dark tunnel where he could do nothing but observe so go through the tunnel and the airlock to the pedestal with the five crystals
He finds that the blue rod he acquired in the cave beyond the waterfall near the planetarium can be placed in one of the three holes to the right of the crystals and when he does so rods rise from the other two holes
By clicking on the tops of these rods he can raise and lower them as indicated by the small red arrows
Click on the dark crystal and the top of it becomes brighter
Observe it carefully as you slide one of the rods slowly upward you will see that as you do so at one point it becomes incrementally brighter
Move another rod until this happens again
Repeat raising and lowering rods until the whole crystal becomes suddenly bright
If in this process the crystal top becomes darker you have moved the rod in the wrong direction or you should try another rod
Do not click on any of the other crystals or it will go dark and you will have to go through the same procedure to make it bright again
Back off from the closeup of the crystals and when you do so a tram goes by on the track outside the control room window probably signifying that the inoperative tram call button now works
Return to the nexus and go down to that tram platform to find that this is indeed the case
The tram puts Low off at the entrance to a cavern above an inlet from the sea
The pathway leads him inward and upward until he reaches the same scene that he saw after producing the moon eclipse in the planetarium with the two moons here seen in the hole in the spire rippling strangely
In the path at his feet there is a stone plate that he can remove using the shovel
When he enters the hole below the plate there on the floor is the black triangle indistinctly seen recently in the holographic map beyond the pit
In the ceiling is a closed shutter with light seeping around it leaving Low wishing he could see better
When he puts the blue crystal in the hole in the wall his wish is granted
On the floor is a plate with two quarter moons inscribed on it when he stands on the plate the shutter opens but closes again as he steps off
If he uses the rod he took from the rodent cave on the floor plate it somehow keeps the plate depressed and the shutter open
There doesn rsquo t seem to be anything more that Low can do in this room
Outside however the open shutter and the very bright lights from below show two bright spots in a pile of dirt at the base of the spire next to the path
Removing the dirt he discovers a lens and as he watches a beam comes from the pair of moons strikes the lens and passes below through the open shutter to the triangle on the floor whereupon a statue of a strange beast rises from below on a low platform that takes the place of the triangle
When Low touches the statue it disintegrates
He climbs onto the platform and floats down a very deep shaft
Getting off the platform he goes to the left where he finds a door with a pile of bones on each side
As Low approaches the door a life crystal falls from a niche onto one of the bone piles which then comes to life as a fierce guard beast
He tosses a life crystal on the other bone pile and when it becomes another beast they begin fighting and are crushed by a dislodged rock
Use the engraved rod from the spaceship wreck on a slot beside the door to open it
Through the door and at the end of a causeway Low comes to a large crystal pyramid in which can be dimly seen an alien corpse
Using the PenUltimate he talks to Maggie who is close to being able to read alien
On the pyramid is a panel on which he clicks the same engraved rod used to open the causeway door and the pyramid collapses
He then puts a life crystal on the alien which rises to tower over him
Low tries to talk to it including a conversation line but only gets answers in alien speak
He gives up and the pyramid rises over it
He calls Maggie again to tell her about the alien
Maggie says she can now read the alien markings but as she is talking something overwhelms her
Low tries to call Brink for help but gets no reply
Go back along the causeway and to the platform that Low rode down from the crypt climb on it and ride back up
Leave the crypt and continue along the path to come upon another strange device
When Low tries to construct a light bridge none of the crystal positions will work and he speculates that there is something amiss in the device panel
All of the devices have had panels though none have been accessible but this one is and when you click on it the cursor shows a central light source five surrounding prisms and three crystals the latter being labeled green red and blue
Clicking on the source and then on the prisms moves the light beams around and these must be set so that the beam goes from the light source to a prism splitting at that prism and going to the other three then from each of those to the proper crystal
With the successful arrangement the panel fades and Low can establish the light bridge
Continue along the path and through a hole in the spire Low will come upon Brink working on a relic
Using a conversation line Low can have a long dialogue with Brink
Or not
In any event Brink is very unpleasant not to say inimical and refuses to help rescue Maggie
Brink rsquo s stash of life crystals is on the ground and he will not let Low at them
Low goes into the spire hole and shines his flashlight at the bats in the ceiling and they fly out in great numbers frightening Brink away down the path
Low can now get Brink rsquo s life crystals and he will return them only if Brink goes with him to save Maggie
Off they go
The brief glimpse of Maggie in the library being captured showed what could have been very large insect legs behind her and a spider was seen when Low first entered the nest in the map spire so that is the destination for the two heroes though how Low knew this is unrevealed
The quickest way between spires is the light bridges so send Low out on the one he just built
Fortunately the spires are labeled therefore click on the Map spire to get them there then through the pit to the nest where Maggie is bound in a web next to the wall grate that was seen earlier as a monster spider threatens her
A lot of conversation follows and if the monster is making too much noise for you to understand it move the Sfx slider on the game control panel to the left
When Low tries to get to the exit to the falls the spider moves there and won't let him pass
Click on Brink then on the spider in the conversation line that appears
Brink says one of them must divert the monster while the other gets past and he offers to be the diversion
He jumps to the side gets out his flashlight and lets loose with a string of scientific epithets
The monster moves to him and Low goes to the top of the falls where he pushes over a boulder onto the tilting rock to send water into the grate then returns to the nest
Click on Brink again then on the grate in the conversation line
Brink moves to the grate and uses his flashlight to lure the spider there
A cutscene shows Maggie removing the grate and the spider being washed away
All three are now on the path where Brink says he has fulfilled his part of the bargain and he wants his crystals back
Low is hesitant whereupon Brink knocks him down gets his crystals and runs off
Maggie tells Low that from her work in the library she thinks the aliens have gone to another planet and now want their assistance in returning
From inventory get the tablet that Low picked up in the museum the one that he thought was an alphabet and click it on Maggie
She can read some of it and by a good guess Low decides to go to the small beach with the tablet of twinkling green lights that has the advantage of being nearby
Leave the nest and cross the stone bridge to the cave beyond the tram tunnel
Show the tablet to Maggie again and now she understands
She makes an adjustment to the twinkling lights and an island and walkway rise from the water
They go to an opening in the island that that takes them down to where they find the fourth plate of the set
Somewhat reluctantly they decide to go and talk to Brink
Use the tram to return to the nexus
As they leave the tram there is an earthquake or rather a planetquake after which Brink is heard on the PenUltimate by the worst of coincidences he was reaching in a crack for a life crystal at the time of the tremor and his hand became wedged and now he needs help to get free
He is in the cave beyond the waterfall in the planetarium spire where they find him in great distress
After a lot of talk Low severs Brink rsquo s hand with the jawbone he has had with him so long
Brink claps a life crystal on his arm
More talk
The reasoning is that they now have four plates if not the ones that got them here from Attila then they are duplicates and maybe they can be used to set up a reverse journey back to earth
There is a place to put them in the nexus a triangle next to the last unopened stone door
Brink testily agrees if it gets them home
The scene shifts to the nexus where Low puts the plates in place and the sealed stone door opens
Brink acting ever more irrationally says it did not get them home demands to be left alone and stalks off
Low and Maggie take the tram to the last spire in which they find a weird room later called a lab where there is a rising walkway off of which are several ldquo strange objects rdquo and consoles
The strange objects morph into several shapes when touched one of which appears to be a spaceship
Click on the first console and a closeup appears showing that it has several irregular shimmering green panels and an empty place for one more plus spaces for two life crystals
Back off click on Maggie then click on the alien device in the conversation line
She thinks that inquiries should be made of the alien in the pyramid
Clicking on the alien in the panel wouldn rsquo t hurt Going up the walkway they leave the lab and find another strange device where Low must remove a bird rsquo s nest from the crystal before he can establish the light bridge
Since Brink took all of Low rsquo s life crystals he will need more so cross on the light bridge to the museum spire and go down to the supply of them in the room at the base of the tram terminal steps
After he has taken about four return to the light bridge and go to the tomb spire
Enter the tomb climb onto the platform and go down to the alien in the pyramid at the end of the causeway
Use the engraved rod and a life crystal as before to raise the alien
With Maggie rsquo s acquired knowledge she can talk to it and a conversation line appears
Start with the alien device and when that is exhausted the eye part appears
Exhaust that in turn the alien says to go to the map and he drops another rod in front of him
Though not necessary there is a lot more that may be learned by exhausting the other items in the conversation line note that it can be slid to the left if you want to take the time
When Low picks up the rod and uses the magnifying glass to examine it he finds that it is another crystal rod this one with a silver handle
Travel the light bridges to the Map spire and the holographic map
Input the new crystal forms code in the panel on the central mound and the image that appears is that of the blue rock beach on the copper sea
That location is on this spire on the other side of the nest so go there and find the eye part hidden in a rock
Return to the lab in the cathedral spire
When they get down to the console Brink shows up extremely threatening and demands Low rsquo s life crystals to use in his machine
Unaccountably Low gives them to him and he leaves
Low puts the eye part in the console
It fits but nothing happens
Talk to Maggie
She suggests it needs a life crystal and she has one
When Low tries it the device whatever it is runs briefly and quits
They need another life crystal and Brink has them all including the many that were in the bin in the museum spire
They will have to go to Brink where he is working on the machine relic in the tomb spire
Low decides to retrieve the eye part from the console and take it with him
When they cross the light bridges and get to the top of the tomb spire there is much antagonistic dialogue with Brink
The eye part is the final element that Brink needs to make his life crystal machine work show it to Brink and Low makes a wordy bargain with him
Low puts the eye part in a slot in the machine it produces two crystals which Low takes along with the eye part
In a cutscene Brink attacks Low ducks and Brink goes over the cliff
After more words with Maggie just be sure that he has enough life crystals Low puts the eye part back in the machine and makes two more
Retrieving the eye part they return to the device in the lab
While Maggie stays at the top of the walkway Low goes down and puts the eye part and the life crystals in the console then goes back up to talk to Maggie
Click on the alien device in the conversation line for another long discussion after which they are back down near the bottom of the walkway
There is a video of Maggie ascending the walkway pushing console buttons as she does and near the top pulling hard to free something stuck
When she does the Eye is recharged but Maggie perishes
Low leaves and goes up to the light bridge and starts to cross it to the Eye but an inner portal in the Eye opens and a guardian beast drives him back to the path then retreats but remains on the light bridge snarling and blocking the way to the Eye
Click on the strange device then on the button to turn off the bridge and drop the beast into the sea
Reestablish the bridge go into the Eye click on the spherical portal and watch mdash or suffer through mdash the hokey ending
There is a slightly different ending but not very much
Since Low has made extra life crystals have him break his promise to Maggie and revive her after she dies
After she runs away send Low across the light bridge to the Eye dispatch the beast and endure essentially the same hokey ending

Banner for wind When successful in defeating Tuya Tuya changes into a snake
Follow the snake to the naos
Duel with Tuya the snake Click the
icon to read the rules of the game
Maya or Tuya can move or cast a spell
Maya can move and cast a spell on all directions
The snake can move only on each side but not backwards
The snake can cast spell on all directions
Each square can be bewitched Blue for Maya and red for the snake
The opponents square can be neutralized and immune to spells for one turn
Maya dies on red square but the snake loses only a segment of its body when it lands on a blue square so it has more chances of progressing in the game but Maya has only one chance
Left click to move and right click to cast a spell
Click on lower top icon to restart puzzle
My strategy was Constantly have one square separating Maya and the snake
Make a lot of blue squares
Move close and try to cut of segments of the snake body while on the snake's side or diagonal to hit the head
Good luck and happy snake cutting

Reproduction in any form without express permission from the author is prohibitedThis is the complete walkthrough for the very good game The Longest Journey
This is a game I really liked to play and it was really entertaining
The game has many little things you have to solve and it was these tiny things I used most of the time to solve
The rest of the puzzles were not of the hardest I ve tried and most of them can be solved by just using logic
The same goes for the dialogue between the characters
Think logically before giving your answer and you will not answer the wrong way Also only use this walkthrough if you re really stuck
Try to solve the puzzles yourself first and you will get so much more out of the game since I ve only written the solve for things you HAVE to do and not all the characters to talk to or things to explore that makes the game more fun to play
And remember that no matter what you get into April can never die pretty cool quality if you ask me and because of that the game will never end in a dangerous situation The walkthrough can be freely distributed as long as my name is not removed or the walkthrough changed without my approval Well that s enough talk let s get on with the game
Have fun PrologueThe prologue is simple not much to do here Go to the right break the branch off the tree and talk to its voice before you grab an eggshell from the nest Go further to the right and use the branch and eggshell with the little stream Talk to the voice again Chapter One PrenumbraTake the diary and the photograph from the nightstand Take a closer look at the diary and find a list Open the closet and take the monkey from the box Look closer at the monkey and pick its eye out Open the window and look out Loosen the string so that it falls in the water Walk out the door In the dark corner to the right pick a leaf from the plant Go down the stairs to the first floor and take the pink note from the bulletin board Read the note Give the note to Fiona Take the matches on the table Go out and find your way to the academy Take the glove from the trash can and go upstairs Take the palette and start painting Go to the coffee shop and talk to Charlie behind the counter and take some candy from the jar Go further in and talk to Stan
This is a REALLY nice guy
He s fat too
Nag about getting your salary and threaten to quit
Now that s better
Take a look at the poster next to the jukebox and take a ticket from it Look closer at the ticket and look at the address on the side Take some bread from the table Go back to the boardinghouse and look at the machine outside Use the ring with the two wires without a connection Now you have to get the switches to get on a straight line
The big round switch to the left holds one of the switches still while the other turns the three others around When you get it right turn the cap on the ventilator and turn the wheel
Then take the pincers from the hose Go to April s room and look out the window Use the bread on the blue duck and see Donald fly away Pull the chain to get up the string Go back to the coffee shop and pick up the duck Look at the duck in closeup and remove the plaster Go to the subway buy a pass for a week and then catch the train to Caf eacute Roma Talk to Cort eacute z and head back to the boardinghouse to talk to Mickey and Fiona If you answered yes about working go to the coffee shop
If not head back to your room Chapter Two Through the mirrorTalk to Fiona and ask her where Cort eacute z could be before you go back upstairs and ask Zack the same thing At the subway look at the sparks by the railway
April finds out that it s a key Blow up the duck and place it on the pincers and then the string
In some versions of the game there's a bug that screws this up if you do this in closeup
The smartest thing is to do this right in the inventory screen or else the game will show the pincers without the string
A patch fixes this and I don t know if this is the case with the English version but you'd probably better save before you do this anyway
Get the key with your fishing pole
Take the subway and find the cinema to the right from the subway and to the right
Push the trash can to reveal some green goo

Give the form to the workers Ask the receptionist for Form A and give it to the workers Look at the nearest telephone screen and call to it from the other one Go to the workers and tell them both that there is someone one the phone for them Take the screwdriver and fix the cables How long would those two take to find out that
Try to get inside Look at the shelves behind the receptionist and talk to her about getting the form Hurry to fix the cables and run inside Buy a Coke from the vending machine with your cash card Go inside the locker room to the left of the screen Look at the lockers until you see the name Maria Hernand egrave z
Talk with the cop behind the door to the toilet
Haven t we met him before
Open Minelli s locker and take his medicine look at the mirror take the broken part and read the note behind it
Also notice the box in the middle of the shelf Give Minelli his medicine and talk to him about his wife
Hmm what s this all about
Push the light switch and replace the glass eye with the eye from the monkey when it falls out Go out and use the glass eye with the scanner on the door to the right of the vending machine Go inside the archives and search for Warren Hughes in the computer Look at his sister s colonization number before you delete the info about Warren and print it out Search for the colonization number and print out the info Search for Altec s church and look at the name Jacob McAllen
Search for him Go to the next page and look at and write down for yourself the code in the lower corner Turn off the computer and look at the control panel on the document finder across the room Enter the code you saw when you searched for Jacob McAllen Take the papers in the printer before you leave the station and head back to building Warren Give Warren the documents and go to meet his friend at the docks Knock on the door three times and after much nagging you finally get inside This is a weird one but talk to him anyway and give him the cube inside the police file Once outside put the Coke inside the paint mixer and head back to the police station Give the cop the fully loaded Coke by the crash scene Use the piece of mirror with the laser beam and get the AG unit the blinking thing loose with the screwdriver Get back to Burns and give him the AG unit Go to the cathedral and talk to Cort eacute z Chapter Four MonstersGo inside the house and talk to the woman

There s the coin The bozo gets pissed and says you used magic to trick him

Go to the library and ask Yerin for a book you don t know the name of but which is about flying people Read the book and you will see that these people live on the island Alais
Go to the old man at the small dock and ask if he knows some stories about Alais and the flying people Talk to the captain and ask him if he knows the island Alais Go back to the old man and talk to him again April agrees with the old man that if she gets his bird back she will be taken to Alais Go to the cup game stand and exchange the screwdriver for the bird pretty cool one too Talk to Captain Nebev eacute and ask what he needs to get sailing You get to know that some guy named Roper Klakks has captured the wind okay

The end call should be at the volcano so that the message can be broadcast all over the island and be heard by Q'aman wherever he is

Parabolic dishes Go to the door across the hall and see a world map
Take the blank note taken from Johnson's pocket In inventory use the lighter on the note
The top part of the note has the letters NA EU AF AU SA
They are abbreviations of continents
Press the continents in sequence North America Europe Asia Africa Australia and South America
Enter and see a parabolic dish
This is one of the shown on the drawing at last page of Graham's diary
To silence the transmission the receivers dishes should not get any signal input
Based on Graham's diary only stations are needed to be turn off to sabotage the whole system
Based on the Bermuda Relay Station is the one that is receiving signal input from North America
Since you have destroyed that relay station also verified by the 'no signal input' on the stand by the stairs in the bulkhead no adjustment is needed
The other parabolic dishes will not receive any transmission if they are all adjusted to receive input from North America via the destroyed Bermuda Triangle relay station
So the object of the puzzle is to adjust all the dishes to point at North America
To know which dish receives transmission from which continent Familiarize yourself by going down the stairs and make a whole rotation back to Dish
Note that each dish room has a stand that is used to rotate the dish
In between the stairs is a map that shows the continent that a dish is receiving data from
Since we know that dish is for North America then we know which map shows where that dish is pointing to To verify that dish is for NA take note of the setting on the stand
Move the dish using the arrows to either right or left extreme
Go to the North America map and see that the highlighted area has moved
Go back to the stand and enter again on the stand
Now we know is for reception of North America transmissions
Based on the layout a dish points to a continent shown by the map across it
Turn the dishes to point to North America Go to the stand on each dish room and click on the arrows to turn the dish
Turn the dish to extreme right or left 'as far as it goes' Look at the map that shows its target and see if it points to North America or to a continent that is adjusted to point to N America in its relay
dishes are needed to be silenced
Dish and are now pointed at North America
Bulkhead Watch the monitors in the bulkhead go down and then silence
The stand shows the adjustments for dish and as no signal input
A fly did a world shattering act it landed on the pad of the control stand thereby checked the system
The system crash alert blared

Tulio wants to go back to Spain with gold and Miguel wants to stay in El Dorado
Cortes' coming to look for El Dorado spoils their plans
They have to seal the city from the outside world by filling the water entrance to El Dorado
To do so they have to start the flow of water in the Water Temple and as the young girl guide points out only Tzekel Kahn knows how
Aside from that there are monsters in the temple
The partners split up inside the water temple Water TempleTulio Turn left and enter a room with a trap door on the floor
The lever to open and close it is on the wall on the top left of the screen
Go to the next room and see awater gatewith an open archway behind it
Go forward to the next room and see a closed door at top of the screen that says Only the bearer of the Sun Gem may pass
To the right of that a door says Only the bearer of the Evil Eye may pass
To the left of the sun gem door is acontraptionthat is missing some cogs
To the left of that is a Jaguar Pump
Go back to the entrance of the temple and turn to the right archway where Miguel entered
On the right side of the screen is another water gate and right across that is acoglying on a cloth
Pick it up
Enter the next room and find the second trap door on the floor
The lever to open and close it is on the opposite side of the room at the bottom right of the screen
At the top part of the room is a face with a gem as an eye
Enter the room at the top and pick up anothercoglying on the floor by the wall between the two openings
Enter the next room and under the wall mosaic on the top part of the room pick up the thirdcog
Go back to the Jaguar pump room at the other side of the temple and place the cogs individually on the contraption
Pick up theSun Gemthat falls from above
Go through the Sun Gem door and find a stone jaguar on a pedestal

Move forward to the room on the right and pry the eye from theface on the wallwith sword
Go to theevil eye doorat the opposite end of the temple
Enter and lower theother water gatewith the sword
Enter through the archway and see thethird water gate
Try lowering it and the stone jaguar comes to life Stone Jaguar Puzzle The main objective of the puzzle is to get the stone jaguar on top of a trap door and to pull the lever to open it
The best strategy I found is to run to the other trap door in the room where the evil eye was obtained
Go across the other side of the room making the stone jaguar cross the trap door on the floor and pull the lever
Or lure the jaguar to the entrance area run back to the room to the left across the trap door and pull lever
Both heroes do this puzzle
Tulio runs from the sun gem room traps the jaguar and the grate back at the sun gem room opens
Miguel runs from the evil eye room traps the jaguar goes back to the evil eye room and uses his sword on thewater gate
Now all three water gate are opened
Look for Tulio back at the sun gem room
Together again
Miguel pulls the lever in the sun gem room
We're going to die
Walls groans cogwheels turn and water pours from the Jaguar pump
They did it
On the way out of the temple see water flowing in all reservoirs Tulio with Chel leaves El Dorado in a boat full of tributes of gold
Miguel stays behind as a God
The tower being pulled to block the entrance to the city to stop Cortes and his troops is going down too fast and is going to smash Tulio's ship
The ship's mast is stuck and would not unroll to provide speed
With the help of the Chief the natives try to hold back the tower
Miguel jumps on Altivo rides to the ship soars through the air reminiscent of an ancient Inca legend and catches the mast and unrolls it
Together again they ride the giant waves caused by the tower that crashed on the river
The boat overturns and the gold tributes spill out
The company gets swept out through the entrance of El Dorado
Falling rocks seal the entrance behind the waterfall
The still optimistic Miguel is joyous while Tulio grumbles about lost fortune
The friends partners in adventure sail on the barge while Chel washes clothes and Altivo is pulled in a boat behind
And that is the story of Tulio and Miguel

Enter Oldreif's home and talk with him
Always exhaust all dialogues
He mentions having to tie the pontoon bell because it is so windy
Talk with Oldreif about the possibility of leaving the island through the forest
Oldreif refuses to let you cross the bridge because the Pillagers in the forest are too dangerous
Noral appears
Talk with him as well
He will show you a frightening scene reflected in a mirror
Your son Jolan is in danger apparently by Thorgal's own hand
Speak with Noral again
He mentions a fisherman named Maleb who could lend you his boat
Noral leaves and you are standing outside
Go right to the end of the village where the drawbridge is located
Examine the mechanism and discover that there is a piece missing
Return halfway to the village
Just to the right of the point where you stop is a spot on the ground where you can stand
From there you can shoot arrows at the rotating target
Aim at the center of the target and release the arrow as the target is facing away from you
That way the timing is correct and the arrow will strike the target when it is facing you
Now talk to the woman who is working on the far side of the walk
She tells you about the Dragon
She tells you that the key to the bridge is hidden in Oldreif's home
If you have successfully shot three arrows into the target she gives you her son'sknife
Go around the side of the house where you first arrived and find theBell
Use the knife to cut the rope
Right click for inventory
A timer starts as you enter Oldreif's house and you have only a brief time to take the lever for the drawbridge before he returns
It is located behind the shield just to the right of the entrance
Go to the drawbridge insert the lever it looks like a garden fork to me and pull it to raise the bridge
Cross the bridge and into the Pillagers' Forest
Enter the forest and take the first left path then the next right path This brings you to an encounter with a rather unpleasant oaf who is guarding a stone bridge
Approach him to start a rumble then back away
Shoot at the three cords holding up the shields and symbols over his head
The material drops stunning him
From here take the path at the bottom left and find theIron Bowon the ground below the path
Looks sort of like a large snake sitting there
Go back to the guy you knocked out and examine the body
Click once to discover the strange object statue and click again to take it with you
Cross his little bridge and proceed to take the left fork
This will take you to the old man's house
Talk with him
Show him the Iron Bow you found
He is grateful to get Andrulf's bow back
He soon sends you on your way
Return to the fork and find aRopeon the ground near the left end of the large log
Now take the other path the one to the lower right
Behold the Dragon
Look on the stone wall just in from of Thorgal's face
Press the Triangle
You may have to click once to approach it and again to activate it
A stone panel opens to your left
Approach the hole and use the statuette on it
A D wooden puzzle is revealed
Here is the shortest solution
Start by rotating the puzzle so you are looking at the left rear quarter
Push the pieces and as indicated
Rotate it so you are looking at the right front quarter and important tip it forward
Push in the mouth part No
then push down on the right rear column TWICE
The dragon's fire is extinguished
Go forward only to discover that the Dragon is a fake put there to scare people
Proceed further to the Fortress
Walk up close to the base of the tower and inspect the grille
A grapple could reach it but you only have a rope and still need a hook of some sort
Go see the Old Man and ask for help
The bow and arrow game will not be activated until you quot need quot the grapple and ask the man for it
He has made a special arrow that you must earn by displaying your skill at archery
Look for the hotspot on the ground similar to the one you stood on before when shooting arrows behind the house
The trick to this challenge is getting the timing correct
Return to the Fortress
Combine the rope and grapple that the Old Man gave you
Swing the grappling hook at the Grille and enter the Fortress

Pick up stones at the very bottom left of the screen
Walk toward location two in the picture Stand there until Vymir starts to walk toward you
When he gets to point throw a stone at him making him run
Walk toward the notch in the wall
Step aside and he will fall through the notch
Pick up the key that Vymir dropped and enter the Fortress
When inside go to theright
You come to a Tee intersection where you can go down and left or up and right
If you look at the lower corridor you discover a fissure which you cannot cross
You will have to find something to help you cross the gap
The other way up leads to a small room
On the way there notice aboard solidly attached to the wall
In the room find thetongssitting on a box at the left and akeysitting on the large barrel to the right side of the room
Exit this room and use the tongs to loosen the board
Take the board
Return to the place where you entered and take the other corridor to the left
Go around the next corner and to the door at the far end
Open it with the key
Stop Before you let Thorgal touch anything search the room until you discover the location ofsix objects but Don't Touch Them Yet
AContaineron the right side of the bookshelvesABoardleaning against the wall just right of the bookshelvesACrucibleon the far right end of the workbenchABottle of Wateron the bench in the middleAGreen Stone Emerald
in the bottom left corner of the screen hard to see ADistillation Device on the lab table bottom right of the screen The moment Thorgal touches any one of these objects the gate will close and lock
Your quot host quot decides to purify the laboratory
A timer starts and it only runs for two minutes not giving you much time to experiment
Pick up the first five objects
Combine the Green Stone with the Crucible grinding it into a powder
Put the Green Powder into the distillation device
Put the Water into the distillation device
Collect the Acid dripping from the end of the coiled tube by using the flask
Use the Acid to burn through the lock on the gate and exit
You will have to touch the Eye of the Dragon whatever that means
Return to the room with the gap and combine the two boards
Use them to jump to the stones pick up the board and use them to cross again
Continue into the Fortress and go left into the room with the red and gold carpet
On the wall is a carved dragon whose eye is a hotspot
If you don't see it at first wait and it will sparkle briefly
Touch the eye and you hear a door open
It is at the end of the other corridor
Enter the room
Uh oh those holes in the floor look pretty ominous
Have you ever watched Battlebots
Step forward and meet Hiralgur Pillager in Chief
He is not pleased that you have conquered his two sons
Step forward again and you are in really deep trouble
The spikes rise randomly and Thorgal can only survive a few hits
In order to stop the mechanism shoot the sandbags from their ropes
I found that stabilizing the mouse with two hands made the job considerably easier
Shoot at the ropes as they are rising before they reach the top of their travel
Be patient you will probably die a few times while developing the skill to get through this segment
When you understand just how it is done you will be able to knock off the four sandbags right in a row
When you get the fourth rope the machine stops Hiralgur dies from his own trap
He triggers something and the room floods with water
This is the last Thorgal will be seeing of the natural world for quite some time
Talk at length to Noral
He unravels the whole point of the story the tragic loss of his loved one and being eternally doomed by immortality
When he is finished talk with the Guardian of the Keys
She will open a portal ofthings past
Enter
Talk to the child exhaust all dialogues
You need to find a box and a disk
Go through the portal
You find the second door locked examine the pedestal to the right of the door
A triangular object will probably open the door
Continue and take the corridor to the left of the four small doors
There is a series of magnetic fields preventing you from reaching the door
Notice the triangular switch at the left of the door
Shoot the switch with an arrow initiating a repeating cycle in the deadly magnets
Watch the red lights at the ends of the magnets to determine when each one is off
Be careful not to step too far proceed by stepping over the magnets while they are inactive
Enter the room and take the glass triangle that is on the edge of the console opposite the entrance More information about the magnets gt Exit this room and go back to the four small doors
In one room you can take a small steel key
I am not sure if the position of the door containing the key changes from game to game mine was in the second door from the left
The other three doors contain nothing you can take
Finally continue and enter the last large room to the far right
When you approach the center of the room the laser robot comes to life and is determined to kill you
Deactivate the robot by pressing the six pyramids atop the poles
Hurry
You must proceed to each pole then touch each pyramid to turn them off
Take the disk which is at the triangular stand by the robot's lair
Go to the locked door and use the triangle on the pedestal to reveal a logic puzzle
The object of this puzzle is to discover which five symbols are the correct ones and in which sequence
You will probably want to have a pencil and paper handy
Choose five of the symbols from the panel at the left and press the green button to check your accuracy
If a flashing green light appears it is one of the correct symbols but you have it in the wrong position
If a steady green light appears the correct symbol is in the correct position
If no light appears the symbol is not to be used
You have five chances to test your accuracy
The required symbols randomly change each time you restart the puzzle
Getting all five correct will unlock the door
You can hear it click
Go in and use the steel key to open the cabinet containing the box
Return to the child combine the disk and the box and the boy's memory is restored
He relates the tale of his ancestors and how he came to be saved by the Vikings
He is young Thorgal
Take the ring he leaves on the floor it is half of a key you will need
Return to the Lands Between
Talk to the Guardian of the Keys
She now opens the next portal of thingsyet to be
Talk to Death the Grim Reaper at the entrance
You must find a lost soul and convince her to return with you
Enter the caverns
You see three paths the center one will take you to theBlind Archer
Go there and talk with him
You learn that the butterflies are souls and that you will need to find a gold and silver mask
Also you must find two crystal pieces to help the Blind Soul regain his sight
Leave the blind man and go to the upper left retrieving the Rose
Return to the first crossroad and find the Crystal Piece sitting on the ground on the right hand edge of the blue ramp Hard to see
Then go to the far right path then the upper right path and find the second Crystal Piece easy to see
Give both crystal pieces to the Blind Soul and take theGold Headbandthat he leaves behind
Climb the blue ramp from the crossroad and speak to theMute Angel He challenges you to a game of Runes
The white game is for practice and the black game is for high stakes either the Silver Gag or your imprisonment
You should first choose the white game in order tolearn the rulesand practice the game
Playing the black game Thorgal must win three times
If he loses three times it is over
Upon winning Thorgal receives the silver gag
Combine the silver and gold pieces to create the mask
You hear a woman singing in the caves
Go to the lowest point always taking the right fork
If you are going the correct way you will hear the singing get louder
Find the red butterfly
Do not attempt to talk to it or examine it
It will be frightened and fly away
Instead give it the Red Rose
The red soul is transformed into Alianne Noral's long lost love
She tells you his pendant must be destroyed in order to end his immortality
Remember this information
She agrees to leave the cave in order that you can help
Kriss is unreal but dangerous nonetheless
She has trapped apparitions of your wife son and daughter in hanging cages
She attempts to shoot down the cages
If she does this three times you are doomed
You must shoot each of the three cables connecting the top and bottom of each cage in order to free the apparitions Aim at the middle of each cable
After Thorgal frees his family the Guardian of the Keys presents him with some sand from the Lands Between and allows him to return to Mitgard
Talk to Maleb the Fisherman
He would be happy to help you but his boat was smashed in a storm
Go to the end of the dock and place the miniature boat in the water
Then use the Moonstone's magic to activate the boat
You are transported to Thorgal's Isle
Go to your home and speak with Aaricia
She tells you the children are at the beach fishing
Cross the island and find Jolan and Louve
Talk to Louve and try to talk to Jolan
Wake him up with the sand the Guardian gave you
He tells you about an old man and what he saw before he fell asleep
Talk to him until Noral appears
He's a duplicate of Jolan
Suggest you save your game right after you see the flashback from the mirror and before Noral appears The AutoSave would take you back to your first arrival on the island making it necessary to repeat all the dialogues
After Noral appears on the beach first as Jolan then as the raven run double click back to your home
Take up a position close to the house and click on Noral to get his attention then discharge an arrow at him hitting the pendant and setting him free from the bonds of immortality
Talk to him and the ending sequence follows
Further help with the Magnets There is a pattern which will grant safe access to the other side of the corridor There are five rectangular blocks that are affected by the lights
The fifth and final block is also a safe area from which you can open the door
This can be completed in six steps Wait until the first two blocks are safe to cross and then go to the end of the second block Go forward one more block when lights change againWait a turnWait another turnStep forward once when lights change againStep forward once when lights change againPress the triangle to the left of the door and then click on the door to open it

Enter Oldreif's home and talk with him
Always exhaust all dialogues
He mentions having to tie the pontoon bell because it is so windy
Talk with Oldreif about the possibility of leaving the island through the forest
Oldreif refuses to let you cross the bridge because the Pillagers in the forest are too dangerous
Noral appears
Talk with him as well
He will show you a frightening scene reflected in a mirror
Your son Jolan is in danger apparently by Thorgal's own hand
Speak with Noral again
He mentions a fisherman named Maleb who could lend you his boat
Noral leaves and you are standing outside
Go right to the end of the village where the drawbridge is located
Examine the mechanism and discover that there is a piece missing
Return halfway to the village
Just to the right of the point where you stop is a spot on the ground where you can stand
From there you can shoot arrows at the rotating target
Aim at the center of the target and release the arrow as the target is facing away from you
That way the timing is correct and the arrow will strike the target when it is facing you
Now talk to the woman who is working on the far side of the walk
She tells you about the Dragon
She tells you that the key to the bridge is hidden in Oldreif's home
If you have successfully shot three arrows into the target she gives you her son'sknife
Go around the side of the house where you first arrived and find theBell
Use the knife to cut the rope
Right click for inventory
A timer starts as you enter Oldreif's house and you have only a brief time to take the lever for the drawbridge before he returns
It is located behind the shield just to the right of the entrance
Go to the drawbridge insert the lever it looks like a garden fork to me and pull it to raise the bridge
Cross the bridge and into the Pillagers' Forest
Enter the forest and take the first left path then the next right path This brings you to an encounter with a rather unpleasant oaf who is guarding a stone bridge
Approach him to start a rumble then back away
Shoot at the three cords holding up the shields and symbols over his head
The material drops stunning him
From here take the path at the bottom left and find theIron Bowon the ground below the path
Looks sort of like a large snake sitting there
Go back to the guy you knocked out and examine the body
Click once to discover the strange object statue and click again to take it with you
Cross his little bridge and proceed to take the left fork
This will take you to the old man's house
Talk with him
Show him the Iron Bow you found
He is grateful to get Andrulf's bow back
He soon sends you on your way
Return to the fork and find aRopeon the ground near the left end of the large log
Now take the other path the one to the lower right
Behold the Dragon
Look on the stone wall just in from of Thorgal's face
Press the Triangle
You may have to click once to approach it and again to activate it
A stone panel opens to your left
Approach the hole and use the statuette on it
A D wooden puzzle is revealed
Here is the shortest solution
Start by rotating the puzzle so you are looking at the left rear quarter
Push the pieces and as indicated
Rotate it so you are looking at the right front quarter and important tip it forward
Push in the mouth part No
then push down on the right rear column TWICE
The dragon's fire is extinguished
Go forward only to discover that the Dragon is a fake put there to scare people
Proceed further to the Fortress
Walk up close to the base of the tower and inspect the grille
A grapple could reach it but you only have a rope and still need a hook of some sort
Go see the Old Man and ask for help
The bow and arrow game will not be activated until you quot need quot the grapple and ask the man for it
He has made a special arrow that you must earn by displaying your skill at archery
Look for the hotspot on the ground similar to the one you stood on before when shooting arrows behind the house
The trick to this challenge is getting the timing correct
Return to the Fortress
Combine the rope and grapple that the Old Man gave you
Swing the grappling hook at the Grille and enter the Fortress

Pick up stones at the very bottom left of the screen
Walk toward location two in the picture Stand there until Vymir starts to walk toward you
When he gets to point throw a stone at him making him run
Walk toward the notch in the wall
Step aside and he will fall through the notch
Pick up the key that Vymir dropped and enter the Fortress
When inside go to theright
You come to a Tee intersection where you can go down and left or up and right
If you look at the lower corridor you discover a fissure which you cannot cross
You will have to find something to help you cross the gap
The other way up leads to a small room
On the way there notice aboard solidly attached to the wall
In the room find thetongssitting on a box at the left and akeysitting on the large barrel to the right side of the room
Exit this room and use the tongs to loosen the board
Take the board
Return to the place where you entered and take the other corridor to the left
Go around the next corner and to the door at the far end
Open it with the key
Stop Before you let Thorgal touch anything search the room until you discover the location ofsix objects but Don't Touch Them Yet
AContaineron the right side of the bookshelvesABoardleaning against the wall just right of the bookshelvesACrucibleon the far right end of the workbenchABottle of Wateron the bench in the middleAGreen Stone Emerald
in the bottom left corner of the screen hard to see ADistillation Device on the lab table bottom right of the screen The moment Thorgal touches any one of these objects the gate will close and lock
Your quot host quot decides to purify the laboratory
A timer starts and it only runs for two minutes not giving you much time to experiment
Pick up the first five objects
Combine the Green Stone with the Crucible grinding it into a powder
Put the Green Powder into the distillation device
Put the Water into the distillation device
Collect the Acid dripping from the end of the coiled tube by using the flask
Use the Acid to burn through the lock on the gate and exit
You will have to touch the Eye of the Dragon whatever that means
Return to the room with the gap and combine the two boards
Use them to jump to the stones pick up the board and use them to cross again
Continue into the Fortress and go left into the room with the red and gold carpet
On the wall is a carved dragon whose eye is a hotspot
If you don't see it at first wait and it will sparkle briefly
Touch the eye and you hear a door open
It is at the end of the other corridor
Enter the room
Uh oh those holes in the floor look pretty ominous
Have you ever watched Battlebots
Step forward and meet Hiralgur Pillager in Chief
He is not pleased that you have conquered his two sons
Step forward again and you are in really deep trouble
The spikes rise randomly and Thorgal can only survive a few hits
In order to stop the mechanism shoot the sandbags from their ropes
I found that stabilizing the mouse with two hands made the job considerably easier
Shoot at the ropes as they are rising before they reach the top of their travel
Be patient you will probably die a few times while developing the skill to get through this segment
When you understand just how it is done you will be able to knock off the four sandbags right in a row
When you get the fourth rope the machine stops Hiralgur dies from his own trap
He triggers something and the room floods with water
This is the last Thorgal will be seeing of the natural world for quite some time
Talk at length to Noral
He unravels the whole point of the story the tragic loss of his loved one and being eternally doomed by immortality
When he is finished talk with the Guardian of the Keys
She will open a portal ofthings past
Enter
Talk to the child exhaust all dialogues
You need to find a box and a disk
Go through the portal
You find the second door locked examine the pedestal to the right of the door
A triangular object will probably open the door
Continue and take the corridor to the left of the four small doors
There is a series of magnetic fields preventing you from reaching the door
Notice the triangular switch at the left of the door
Shoot the switch with an arrow initiating a repeating cycle in the deadly magnets
Watch the red lights at the ends of the magnets to determine when each one is off
Be careful not to step too far proceed by stepping over the magnets while they are inactive
Enter the room and take the glass triangle that is on the edge of the console opposite the entrance More information about the magnets gt Exit this room and go back to the four small doors
In one room you can take a small steel key
I am not sure if the position of the door containing the key changes from game to game mine was in the second door from the left
The other three doors contain nothing you can take
Finally continue and enter the last large room to the far right
When you approach the center of the room the laser robot comes to life and is determined to kill you
Deactivate the robot by pressing the six pyramids atop the poles
Hurry
You must proceed to each pole then touch each pyramid to turn them off
Take the disk which is at the triangular stand by the robot's lair
Go to the locked door and use the triangle on the pedestal to reveal a logic puzzle
The object of this puzzle is to discover which five symbols are the correct ones and in which sequence
You will probably want to have a pencil and paper handy
Choose five of the symbols from the panel at the left and press the green button to check your accuracy
If a flashing green light appears it is one of the correct symbols but you have it in the wrong position
If a steady green light appears the correct symbol is in the correct position
If no light appears the symbol is not to be used
You have five chances to test your accuracy
The required symbols randomly change each time you restart the puzzle
Getting all five correct will unlock the door
You can hear it click
Go in and use the steel key to open the cabinet containing the box
Return to the child combine the disk and the box and the boy's memory is restored
He relates the tale of his ancestors and how he came to be saved by the Vikings
He is young Thorgal
Take the ring he leaves on the floor it is half of a key you will need
Return to the Lands Between
Talk to the Guardian of the Keys
She now opens the next portal of thingsyet to be
Talk to Death the Grim Reaper at the entrance
You must find a lost soul and convince her to return with you
Enter the caverns
You see three paths the center one will take you to theBlind Archer
Go there and talk with him
You learn that the butterflies are souls and that you will need to find a gold and silver mask
Also you must find two crystal pieces to help the Blind Soul regain his sight
Leave the blind man and go to the upper left retrieving the Rose
Return to the first crossroad and find the Crystal Piece sitting on the ground on the right hand edge of the blue ramp Hard to see
Then go to the far right path then the upper right path and find the second Crystal Piece easy to see
Give both crystal pieces to the Blind Soul and take theGold Headbandthat he leaves behind
Climb the blue ramp from the crossroad and speak to theMute Angel He challenges you to a game of Runes
The white game is for practice and the black game is for high stakes either the Silver Gag or your imprisonment
You should first choose the white game in order tolearn the rulesand practice the game
Playing the black game Thorgal must win three times
If he loses three times it is over
Upon winning Thorgal receives the silver gag
Combine the silver and gold pieces to create the mask
You hear a woman singing in the caves
Go to the lowest point always taking the right fork
If you are going the correct way you will hear the singing get louder
Find the red butterfly
Do not attempt to talk to it or examine it
It will be frightened and fly away
Instead give it the Red Rose
The red soul is transformed into Alianne Noral's long lost love
She tells you his pendant must be destroyed in order to end his immortality
Remember this information
She agrees to leave the cave in order that you can help
Kriss is unreal but dangerous nonetheless
She has trapped apparitions of your wife son and daughter in hanging cages
She attempts to shoot down the cages
If she does this three times you are doomed
You must shoot each of the three cables connecting the top and bottom of each cage in order to free the apparitions Aim at the middle of each cable
After Thorgal frees his family the Guardian of the Keys presents him with some sand from the Lands Between and allows him to return to Mitgard
Talk to Maleb the Fisherman
He would be happy to help you but his boat was smashed in a storm
Go to the end of the dock and place the miniature boat in the water
Then use the Moonstone's magic to activate the boat
You are transported to Thorgal's Isle
Go to your home and speak with Aaricia
She tells you the children are at the beach fishing
Cross the island and find Jolan and Louve
Talk to Louve and try to talk to Jolan
Wake him up with the sand the Guardian gave you
He tells you about an old man and what he saw before he fell asleep
Talk to him until Noral appears
He's a duplicate of Jolan
Suggest you save your game right after you see the flashback from the mirror and before Noral appears The AutoSave would take you back to your first arrival on the island making it necessary to repeat all the dialogues
After Noral appears on the beach first as Jolan then as the raven run double click back to your home
Take up a position close to the house and click on Noral to get his attention then discharge an arrow at him hitting the pendant and setting him free from the bonds of immortality
Talk to him and the ending sequence follows
Further help with the Magnets There is a pattern which will grant safe access to the other side of the corridor There are five rectangular blocks that are affected by the lights
The fifth and final block is also a safe area from which you can open the door
This can be completed in six steps Wait until the first two blocks are safe to cross and then go to the end of the second block Go forward one more block when lights change againWait a turnWait another turnStep forward once when lights change againStep forward once when lights change againPress the triangle to the left of the door and then click on the door to open it
GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
TIMELAPSE Solution by Lu RichardsonSolution Version Updated th Febraury Puzzle solving adventure by GTE ENTERTAINMENT General tips Although you can move using the mouse I would advise you to use the arrow keys since that way you can see in which directions you can go Try turning on the spot in the different directions available otherwise you might miss something important Needless to say you have to move the mouse around on the screens to see what can be manipulated In the close ups be aware that sometimes it is not enough to click on an item you actually have to place the hand icon on it and move it in the direction you wish the item to move
Early on you will find a journal which can then be accessed by pressing Control J
There is no need to read the whole thing at one go Just read the bits referring to the scenario you are in sometimes you get a clue Fortunately the journal will automatically open in the part corresponding to wherever you are
The items you will find immediately are the camera and the journal
Use the camera sparingly you will need it more later on If you can manage it do simple drawings of the symbols you need to remember You will certainly need pencil and paper
As ever I would suggest you read only up to where you are stuck
The solution EASTER ISLAND Present Day After watching the intro the game starts with you facing some stones From here on quot right quot means your right hand side and quot left quot your left hand side So turn right advance turn right advance get the camera retreat and go back to the stones Turnyour back on them and follow the path Get close to the statue you'll see on the right and retrieve the journal Get back on thepath and follow it At the T junction turn right and advance examining each of the three statues in turn make a sketch of thesymbol at the foot of each statue and then advance to see the glyph on their chests Clicking on the chests produces the glyph again in case you've forgotten it Save the camara for later if you can
When you have done this and know the three symbols and the corresponding glyphs turn right and follow the path to the camp Keep advancing till you are in front of the table Click on it to get a close up Take a piece of paper from the left and place it onthe stone Grab the pencil and bring it over the paper Three more symbols with their glyphs will appear Again record them Step back and turn to the right facing the side table and advance close Examine the instructions to light the lamp take a photo or make a note and get the matches
Back off and turn around Follow the sandy path to your left You can get a close up of the items on the oil drum but I could not do anything with them Perhaps the clear message on the bottle has some meaning which escapes me just now not that it mattered in the long run Continue along the sandy path till you come to the cave
Enter it and advance till you come to the lamp
The lamp puzzleClick on it to get a close up and remember the instructions by consulting your notes or the photograph you took
Place the hand icon over the TANK PUMP to the left and actually move it up and down till you hear it click ten times Make sure you leave it in the DOWN position i e not sticking up as when you started
Click it on the PRIMER VALVE the little lever to the bottom right once to get it in the UP position
Turn the GAS KNOB to the UP position by clicking on it twice
Take a match from the box by placing the hand icon on it and then drag the match along the side of the box to light it Without letting go of it apply it to the MANTLE so that it lights
Click once on the PRIMER VALVE to put it in the DOWN position
When you've done the lamp will be lit and you can proceed
Keep going till you come to a spot where you can turn left and right Look at the statues on the right Turn left and advance Click on the stone face and there will be an outflow of lava a mask will appear on it Examine the glyphs on the eyes of the stone face Click on the stone bowl and water will cool the mask Take it Turn around and go to the statues Put the mask on the hand directly below the symbol which corresponds to the glyph If you make a mistake the mask will disintegrate and you'll have to start again
Go back to the stone face Change the glyph and so the mask by clicking on the left or right eye Again click on the bowl to cool the mask and retrieve it Back to the statues and place the new mask on the hand under the correct symbol Do this till you have all six in position turn to the left and you will see a face with glowing eyes on the rock in front Click on it and you'll bethrough to the time machine
Advance till you get right up close to the globe You will receive a message from your mate You might like to save here Click on the first symbol to the left the scarab and then on the globe
You will be transported to ANCIENT EGYPT Turn right twice and advance to the pool The water talks to you
Advance some more to see the bottom of the pool No need to record what you see it is drawn in the journal Back off and turn right to head for the pyramid Have a look around a statue obligingly tells you to find a scarab and enter it You will find a door with a combination lock on it
Return to the spot from where you stared Turn left and head for the barge Have a good look around so that you know whereeverything is Clearly you have to go elsewhere to find out how to open the combination lock and you need to use the barge at the moment immobilized inside a gate Look inside the well and make sure the bucket is right under the spout by moving the lever on the top Go around the stonework construction till you are on the river turn to the left and you will see a hanging basket Click on it FOUR times Walk around to the well Pull the lever on the right Look inside The bucket should contain water and remain under the spout Move the lever at the top Back off turn left and go to the end of the dock Turn left and advance to see a lever Pull this to the left don't just click on it it will go back to its original position Go to the well and pull the top lever to get the bucket under the spout then go back to the basket
Use the basket TWICE Go to the well and pull the lever on the right Look in the bucket should be full Back off pull thelever on the top Go back to the dock and to the lever Pull that to the left and the gate will open Get on the barge and walk to the front of it You sail off
When you get to the Temple step off the barge and turn right around Get the spear Turn right around advance and you will be greeted by a crocodile Now this is tricky When the croc moves his head to the left point the spear at a spot on his neck by the base of his lower jaw While his head is turned to the left click on the spear to stab him in that spot There is no point in trying to stab him anywhere else so persist when you hit the right bunch of pixels he will disappear
Advance into the Temple You can do this in any order but we'll try to save time Go to the room to the left remember YOUR left of the circular altar and examine everything If you click on the statue of Annubis he'll tell you to quot find the tablet quot In one of the baskets you'll find a mirror Step back and use the mirror on the wall to read a message Now go to the bottom of the room and slide the mirror over the vessels On the right hand side you will see an elaborate key With the mirror over it grab it Find the locked chest use the key on the lock and then advance and open it
You will find an amusing head whose eye will follow the movements of the pointer Click on the tablet and record what you see
Basically you are being told which number each symbol represents
For instance the first one is next to a knife so the number of knives you find in the Temple is the number this particular symbol represents Get counting
When you've finished in this room go out and turn immediately right Advance and turn left Spot the symbols on the cracklingcolumn and click on the lowest one Proceed to the room opposite
Now I suggest you do the following to make it easier for yourself
Get a sheet of paper and draw seven equally spaced lines across and four equally spaced lines down You will soon find out why Open the first casket you come to and inspect each scroll in turn On your piece of paper draw on the first square an approximation of the face you see on the scroll and in the next square along the name of the god plus the type of face it has i e goat crocodile etc
Examine all of the scrolls doing this Count them
Turn around and leave the room Go to the statue head in the middle and move the orb slowly You will see the face of each god and on it a symbol On the piece of paper draw the symbol alongside the face and the name of each god in your third squares
Go back to the room you've just left Still counting all the objects you come across click on the statue to the left for another scroll If you examine this scroll you will see Egyptian numbers in front and after the gods faces record this Consult the journal and you'll find out that a number before a god is to be substracted and a number after a god is to be added It will allbecome clear later on Continue exploring and counting At the end you should know what number each symbol on the tabletrepresents
OK let's leave and go to the symbols on the crackling column
Press the middle one Leave the temple and turn to the right Walk right around the temple till you are facing the row of obelisks
Advance between the first pair turn to your left and look at it
You will see the face of a god and a number Write that number down on the fourth square on your piece of paper alongside the right god and on the fifth the position of the column in the arrangement you could see when you started e g A to the left A to the right B B C C D D Turn right around and examine the face and the number on the next obelisk let's call this obelisk A Advance along all the obelisks doing this and enter the building You will see eight crystal obelisks corresponding in position to the real ones outside
Turn left to the first one A There are three wheels to click on The first will be the face of a god which you will have tochange to the one you saw on the corresponding obelisk in this case Thoth the ibis the second wheel is the number you sawoutside in this case one the third wheel is the symbol of the god which you saw moving the ball in the temple in this case wings and entwined serpents However this isn't all The number has to be changed according to the scroll you found inside the statue Is this all beginning to gel No Well to save you the trouble I will tell you which numbers to put in the middle wheels I am sure you'll be able to sort out the other two wheels
This is it by pairs first left then right
A and A For Thoth ibis use II For Sebek croc use I
B and B For Set square ears use the inverted V For Knumm goat use
C and C For Osiris man use the six little bars For Horus hawk use the quot quot number
D and D For Bastet bat use I For Annubis dog use
I hope this makes sense to you it's difficult to explain At any rate go to the altar at the top of the room and click on it Alleight obelisks inside should be lit and a gem should appear in the middle If an obelisk is not lit you've got one of the wheelswrong Go back to it and change things till you get it to light
With the gem go through the door at the top and when you come to a cobra use the gem on it Continue till you come to a well Look in and drop the gem in the water A guy in a funny hat talks to you
Retreat and press the stair symbol on the column to your right
Look into the well and you'll see steps go down them and enter the room to the right Explore around click on everything You'll end up playing a game of snakes and ladders The trick is to get to the yellow square first It's largely out of your control just click on the quot dice quot when it's your turn but if you land next to a snake you can use any gems you have to escape sliding down move the red ones to the other side of the eye with the hand icon the number under the particular snake tells you how many gems to move I didn't bother and I still won The price is the eye symbol you'll see above the game Take it and retreat
Use it on the yellow cabinet alongside its mate Open the cabinet and enter Click on the scroll with the pyramid I believe we've found the code for the combination lock Record it Click on the scarab and you get some more info you carry away with you this artifact Leave and turn to the door through which you came
Advance and click on it to get yet another message Push on to exit
Back to the temple find the crackling column and press the first symbol pyramid Get back on the barge and walk to the front to get across the river Now go to the pyramid and to the door with the combination lock If you added up the symbols on the pyramid scroll top to bottom you will have obtained Place the appropiate number symbols in front of the little triangle to the left and press it Bingo Keep advancing till you get to the time machine
Click on the next button along the first and you will turn up at the ANASAZI Things are going to get a lot tougher I can see that Turn right advance and get the log Head back for the tree at which youstarted turn left and advance When you come up smack against a rock and can't go any further step back and use the log This forms a bridge Move on You will come to a junction Just now continue forward When you reach the stones and the lever ignore it and continue advancing You will see a circle containing other circles on the rock This is actually very important Back off to the lever It has five positions and each gives you access to certain puzzles Every time you visit a new section in this scenario you will see a circle with the season marked on it
Let's start by pushing the lever all the way left Go and see what the circle looks like now it should have a line right through themiddle OK turn around and go to the junction where you will turn right and advance
Turn to your right and note the big cactus This is the most important spot in the whole of this scenario you will have go get here every time you complete a section in order to get to the stones and move the lever we've just pushed and get access to another section
OK if you are facing the cactus turn right around and advance
Ignore the first turning to the right and go on Ignore the nextturning to the right and go on If you keep advancing you will come up against a blank wall Turn right and follow the path to the cave
Pick up the torch move right up to the different walls shake it and shine it around You should see various glyphs and it isimportant that you remember them well so record them Leave the cave Go back to the blank wall and keep advancing Somewhere around here you should see a wolf it is important you remember which animal you see in association with each section i e
with each type of circle or season You should come to a stone with drawings on it What you have to do here is click in the right order on the same symbols you saw in the cave It is not easy because of the hands obscuring the drawings but you should not really have much trouble When you've done turn left and click on the circle on the rock Turn right and enter the cave that has just opened up Have a look around You will see a stone carving come up through the water Right that's that one By the way you must memorise every carving drawing you uncover in this scenario
Make a little sketch of it save your photos for later
Leave the cave and find the blank wall turn right and advance towards the big cactus but take the first turning to the left Youshould be going under the bridge and through a hole in the rock to another cave Have a good look around when you come to the snake on the wall you have a very tiresome puzzle to solve Imagine the footprints under the snake are marked A to H Click on them in the following order means once means twice C D G F G D B D B C H E A E H C B D G D B C H C B D F A F G
Be sure to click on the correct footprint make a mistake and you'll have to start again When you've finished the snake willrattle it's tail Turn to the right and advance to touch the pipe
You get a message To get the full story click on the pipe times Turn right and observe the map on the wall Leave the cave and advance as far as you can go then left and up to the big cactus ignoring the turning to your left
Turn right advance turn left and go all the way to the stones and the lever This time move the lever up once still on the leftside so that it is not quite upright nor flat on its side Back to the cactus facing it
Go all the way forward ignoring the two turnings to the right
Come right up to the wall with the acorn indentation and turn left Pick up the stick Turn left and advance to the first junction
Turn left You should see a squirrel Note also the circle andremember to associate them both Keep going till you come to some bees Use the stick on then and collect a glob of honey on its point Keep going and observe the squirrel it drops an acorn on a rock Advance and you will see the acorn in a crack Use the stick to collect it Turn around and get to the junction then right and all the way to the indentation Put the acorn in it and a cave will open up Enter it have a look around keep advancing and pick up a match Turn to your right and pass the match over the stone to light it then light the fire Turn right around to see the image dancing on the wall Another section done Back to the cactus
Go to the lever and push it to the right but not fully Back to the cactus If you are facing it this time turn left advance turn right at the next junction and going all the way to a contraption on the ground with five holes and a feather impressionon the wall Turn to your left and you will see five birds you have to find their feathers Walk all around the scenario till youfind them You will probably find more than five so you'll have to experiment As far as I could determine the birds are a turkey an owl a hawk a bird I didn't know and a woodpecker When you have found and placed the correct five feathers in the right order click on the feather impression on the rock and the cave to your left will open up Go in and take a look Another carving has emerged Note the leaves and the crows Back to the cactus yet again
Might as well go to the village so if you are facing the cactus turn left and advance all the way till you get to a spear Take itand turn around advance and turn right Puncture the base and quot branches quot of all the cacti around the maize until the speardisappears by which time the corn will be tall enough for you to climb Advance and have a good look all around
Take the maraca from the basket and turn around to the snake Poke it with your finger and the snake will make a noise You have to match it by shaking the maraca as I recall left up and down then let go If this doesn't work keep trying it's not all that difficult When you succeed the snake will turn into a ladder Go up it all the way
At the loom grab the wooden needle to the left and use it on the basket nearest the loom Then take the large ball of red wool and put it in the basket poke at it with your finger and the end of the wool will appear Click on the eye of the wooden needle and it will be threaded now click on the loom and next click on the wooden transversal stick on the loom Repeat with the medium sized reddish ball of wool and then with the smallest reddish ball of wool This should complete the weaving a golden maize plant will appear on the loom Leave remembering that to descend stairs you have to go backwards
Once outside enter the other room Climb up to where the drums are Turn all around note the indentation on the wall in theshape of a leaf Take the drumstick Turn to the chimes and poke them identifying the notes if you can Now turn to the drums and repeat the sequence If you can't try this supposing the drums are lineally numbered i e pretend they are all in a straight line bang the following Turn to the chimes and you will see the fur has fallen off allowing you into another room Enter and pick up the small stick from fire and use it to examine the holes in the wall to your left Only one does not contain a nasty grab what there is in it it's a rag Turn around and dip the rag in the water in the stone container and then use it to clean the wall Very nice Leave the village remembering to go backwards down the steps and down the maize stem
Make your way to the lever and this time push it fully to the right Go to the cactus and facing it advance to the firstjunction turn right and go along here Ignore the turning to the right and continue till you get to the bow Note the hawk Advance to look at the bow handling it will make an arrow appear but it has no head Step back and turn left Advance looking for flints they are hard to see but they are there Grab them and go back to the bow by clicking on the flints when you have an arrow shaft in position the arrow will be armed Advance till you are in position and save your game This nearly drove me nuts You have to put an arrow through the hole in the column in front of you Try putting the arrow parallel to and slightly away from the left side of the column pull it completely back and let fly The relative space between the column and the arrow should be about the width of the arrow's head It's very tough because the wind changes and then you have to change your strategy so be prepared to reload again and again When you finally manage to put an arrow through the hole you'll be hailed as a great hunter Step back turn right around and advance till you can't go any further turning right will reveal a newly opened cave Pop in and see what's on the wall a bison will become a thundering stampede
Right now back to the lever and center it Back at the cactus and facing it advance to the first junction turn right advance turn right and go along here turning right will put you in front of four stones Each slab is topped by the symbol of one of the seasons On the first one to your left you have to click on the crow and on the leaf it doesn't look like a crow but makes a sound like it on the next one click on the top right hand side symbol a kite or a hawk and then on the symbol for the storm Next squirrel and fire Last wolf and drops of water Now click on the circle above the stones and a slab should fall letting you through Inside this chamber you'll get the pod and another message Note the outline of a leaf underneath
OK Now for the last push Go back to the village and to the pit of sand note that the leaf silouette has turned to green Lookinto it an a whole lot of leaves will land artistically on the spiral You have to complete the sequence use the followingnarrow leaves red red and green If this doesn't work instead of starting at the end of the sequence start by placing the greenleaf on the last indentation and then the two red leaves moving up to the rest of the leaves At the end you get a leaf of the rightshape for the indentation we saw in the drum room so let's get there When you place the leaf in the indentation the wall acrossthe roof opens Walk across and enter a chamber
Here there are drawings on the walls either side and behind you and a wheel with arrows which must be turned blue Turn left and click on the bird and the maize plant Turn right twice and click on the bison and the bee Turn right again to face the door and click on the eye surrounded by eyes and on the man with the stick both in the top left hand corner of the wall and also on the man further down with horns If you turn right around all the arrows should be blue if they are not click on another drawing and see what effect it has on the arrows If none click on it again and choose another drawing and so on When all the arrows are blue click on the center of the circle Go through to the time machine After the message click on the fourth symbol from the left because we are going to the MAYAS Well here we go again Get going in the only direction you can
At the first slab turn to the left and click on the head You geta statuette Turn right and look at the slab Keep going and looking at the slabs You will notice a recurring theme skull monkey jaguar and salamander or at least that's what I think they are As you come to the temple you'll see a circular platform
Advance to it and use the statuette on the crackling center A salamander will appear You are about to play a game of Simple Simon Click on the salamander and remember the colours it acquires Click on the coloured tiles in front of the platform in the same order Keep doing this till the salamander disappears Go forth into the temple and have a look around You can go right through and out but you will find that apart from the door directly in front of this particular pyramid all the others are shut Perhaps it's Sunday Go back in
Find the spot with the calendar the head and the sphere and the numbers on the wall this is a good moment to consult the journal to find out which number is which Look at the tablet with the numbers This is a very simple puzzle but just in case imagine that each number is marked A B C D along the first row E F G H along the middle row and I J K L along the bottom row Click on the following numbers in this order A F I B G L C H J and D E K A lever will appear Click on it Turn left the sphere will be mobile now Turn it so that you get the skull
Go outside and find the slab with the skull head on it Click on the skull and three symbols will light up Record them Back tothe calendar Now you've got to align the three symbols along the center line by manipulating the three wheels The inner one with the numbers has sections the next one and the other wheel to the right has sections Basically get the two symbols alongside one another and then jiggle the wheels up and down till you get them correctly aligned with the right number When you've succeeded go to the other pyramids The door to the one on the right with the skulls will be open Turn right and examine the skeleton You have to reconstruct it Now how did it go The thigh bone is connected to the hip bone tra la la la
The skeleton puzzle Save your game before you even begin on this one Start by having a good look at all the bones in the box beneath you will notice that some are white and some are reddish Reload your game and imagine that the box under the skeleton's body is divided into four sections which we will name boxes A B C and D It is very important that when you attempt to attach a bone you slide it gently underneath and don't quite let it touch the other one when you let go it will attach itself If it was too far away it will drop and no harm done However if you touch the other bone the skeleton will collapse In this instance I will refer to the right hand side and left hand side of the skeleton as opposed to YOUR right hand side and left hand side Save a new game every time you successfuly complete a limb
Left arm reddish Top in one piece from box C Lower arm complete with hand from box B Use this as reference for the right arm
Right leg white Top in one piece from box B Lower leg complete with foot from box A Use this as reference for the left leg
Left leg reddish Top one bit from box D the other from box B Lower leg one complete bit from box D foot from box D Right arm white Top one bit from box B the other bit from box A Lower arm thin bit from box D thin bit from box B hand from box C When you've completed it save your game and then click on the stone in the mouth of the skeleton turn right around and put the stone in the middle of the circle You get a message and a picture Record this picture with the camera and also the others which will appear after each message in each temple
OK let's go to the sphere and move it on to the monkey Find the slab click on the monkey's head and record the three symbols etc
I think you've got the idea At the monkey's pyramid to your left as you come down the stairs look around and spot the maze puzzle
You just have to get your green spider through various square holes to the bottom of the board where the blue gem is It's a matter of watching the other spider and moving at the right moment Save each time you elude one of the spiders and you'll have no trouble getting the gem Now turn left advance and use the gem on the circle to get the usual message and another picture
Back to the sphere let's go for the jaguar next You know what to do The jaguar temple is on top of the pyramid opposite Get up there and have a good look all around Above the recumbent green god you will see a circle with colours Note the position of these four colours Go back to the entrance and with your back to it turn right Note the four squares around the jaguar picture
Advance and you are into the puzzle Click on each square to change it not only to the same symbol as around the jaguar picture but also to the colours you saw in the circle all in the right position of course When you've done this you get the golden head of a jaguar
Step back turn left advance till you are at the pile of bones and turn left Advance and use the head on the crucible above thefire It melts and pours into the mould Click on the vessel to the left so that water pours into the mould and cools the piece Look inside the mould if it is still too hot to pick up have a walk around the temple and come back When the heart is cool pick it up turn right around and place it on the cup the recumbent figure is holding You get a gem Back to the door to the right another circle Use the gem on the circle to get the usual Out
Get to the sphere and change it to the salamander Find the right slab and do the usual Now we are going to go out and through the door of the opposite pyramid at ground level Keep going through here till you come to a green statue Turn right to face it and save your game There is a rather revolting game coming up not for the squeamish and if you don't want to spend the rest of your life playing it's as well to adopt a strategy Start the game clicking on any of the skull orifices Write down the sequence in which the opposite skull spews out nasties as you go Although these sequences appear to be random a given set will be often used So having written down the sequence and unless you've won by chance reload the game and do the same Eventually you'll recognise the pattern and will know which creature to use because you know what to expect Save every time you win a game and it will soon be over
Your eventual win means that the hanging bridge is pulled up and youcan go through
Follow the path till you get to the giant head Turn to your right wait till the spider moves and grab the stone Turn left and use it on the left eye of the statue then move the eye to the left You can turn left and walk along here safely and move on till you reach the pyramid Of course you can't enter yet Back to the stone head and turn your back on it You will see a glint in a flower
Advance a couple of times and grab the gem hiding in it Back to the head use the gem on the other eye and move it You get a machete Use it on the vines to the right of the head and you can get through to the salamander pyramid
Once inside look around get hold of the broken heart and put it in the golden basin in front of the statue with the skulls Pushforward for the next puzzle Have a good look at it Consult the journal to establish the numbers on the skulls Step back
Go to the circle on the wall the one with the salamander in the middle and step right up to it Turn right and in the lowerleft hand corner of the screen you will see an object Click on it and you will find the numbers you will have to consult the journal to see which ones the head symbols represent to move the salamander back at the puzzle using the skulls The red symbols refer to the skulls on the left and the black symbols to the skulls on the right Thus you would start by clicking on the first skull on the right five the salamander would move five spaces followed by the first skull to the left four the salamander moves four spaces and so on Guiding yourself by the journal write down the skulls to click on in the right sequence go back to the puzzle and do it At the end you get a salamander Turn to the left and advance on the slab on the floor click on the compartment and place the salamander on the silouette you will see This opens up a floor and you go down
Follow through here and when you can turn left Advance through here At the end turning to your left will reveal another pod
Click on it get another message and when the cylinder raises get the hammer Now place on the cylinder the four skulls and the grey stone not the bone nor the other stones Turn left and advance till you can go no further Turn left and advance Click on the impression of an axe on the side of the doorway and you get a tune
Use the hammer on the five columns in front of the doorway reproducing the same tune I'm sure you'll be able to manage but if you are tone deaf like me this might help imagine the columns are numbered to left to right Hit the following You are through Advance till you come to a skeleton in a coffin hanging on to a gem Grab hold of the gem and move it side to side till you shake it loose I don't know about you but I'm up to here with skeletons and bits thereof OK you know what to do get to the circle in the temple above and use the gem in the middle Message and picture
Now it's time to go to the final temple Go to the stone head face it make sure its left eye is moved to the left turn left andadvance all the way up to the top of the pyramid Wot no gem in the middle Turn right around and advance paces down the pyramid You will see a rock and in a crevice to the bottom right hand side of it a gem Get it and go and put it in the middle of the circle on top of the pyramid This will open the door and will let you advance to the puzzle In this you have to form the four pictures you saw in each temple guide yourself by the numbers indicated to the left and right of the panel with the tiles Bear in mind that once you get together the four pieces of each picture they will fuse and it will be more difficult to move the others so try doing first the bottom right the bottom left then the top right and finally the top left One piece of this last one top left is missing otherwise you could not move the tiles
When you've finished the puzzle the door will open and you will be able to go through to the time gate This time we are going to Atlantis so click on the middle symbol ATLANTIS Start by turning right around and advancing and then turning to the right to enter the pyramid Examine everything with care Click several times on each holograph until the message is repeated to get all the info In this particular building you must activate all three maps by clicking on them Note also the letter symbol either side of the door
Leave and proceed to examine all the other buildings in the same way and make sure you remember their outward shapes clicking on each holograph several times and noting the letter symbol associated with each Sometimes this symbol is obvious sometimes it is not In one of the buildings it's on the floor the one with the DNA in it
When you've been everywhere and examined everything go to the center building Inside turn to your left and advance to input the code this will be obvious to you Just click on each square under each of the buildings till you get the correct symbol or anapproximation they are actually back to front or upside down then click on the last button to the right If you've done itright you can now enter the lift Inside turn right around and examine the controls You will notice that clicking on the symbolto the left of the lit one gets you nowhere so click on the one to the right You go down To get out of the lift just advance andthe doors will open
Now for the first time in this game you are in real danger Save your game Cautiously turn in every direction you can till you spot the robot Be very aware of where you are in relation to the lift
Because you are about to go forth nick the robot's charge and get into the lift pretty damn quick before he kills you Inside the lift use the charge crystal on the appropriate indentation in the control panel and click on the first symbol to the left in order to go up
Aha Now we are getting somewhere Save immediately you don't have a lot of time and you must have a trial run First look around carefully as usual to see where everything is Take your time
One thing you must do is to make a note of the white blue dot sequence you will see behind the sarcophagi some of the dots will be obscured in some cases but you can view them from other angles
Once you have the complete sequence noted look at the empty stasis box Now find the puzzle on the wall and have a bash It's just a matter of getting all the red sectors in the middle and it can be done quite easily clicking on the yellow arrows here and there
While you are messing around you'll probably get killed by the robot No problem
Reload your saved game and go for it Take the crystal from the lift go to the empty stasis box place the crystal in the hole onthe floor enter the stasis box and set the right sequence of dots by clicking on the white ones you want to change to blue Then turn around and tackle the puzzle When you've solved it press the button in the middle Now back off and you find yourself at the power machine and you are supposed to fire on the button above the panel to switch on the stasis field while the robot is trying to get his crystal You have to be very quick about it otherwise Game Over
When you get the robot securely immobilized in the stasis field you can go left to the door which you can now enter Advance and turn to your right click on the round contraption and you will see that your three pods are missing Call them up through pressing the spacebar or whatever and place the hand icon on them to join them to the other one Pick up the four reunited pods Turn left and advance till you get to the panel Click on it place the combined pods in the indentation turn around and go back to the entrance
Turn to your right and advance to the time gate Get the message click on the last button on the right and you will free your mate the ungrateful wretch Now you can stay here or go back in it doesn't matter

by DREAMCATCHER THE ADVENTURE COMPANY The story briefly You are Wales pronounced Wells a scientist inventing a time machine
You manage to get it working and it transports you years into the future when it disappears
You need to find it and repair it in order to return home
The people here do not die they become older or younger at the whim of Khronos who controls everything
You must learn your way around this strange environment and overcome fierce opponents who have no use for strangers
Take some time to get used to walking and navigating
You can press the up arrow continuously and at the same time control your direction with the right and left arrows without stopping
It is a bit unnerving at first watching the overhead view and confusing when Wales is walking toward you because the left and right arrows rotate the walker relative to his point of view not yours
Think of the hero rotating or turning left or right not necessarily going left or right on the screen It is VERY IMPORTANT to become good at moving around early in the game when no one is attacking you
The spacebar is the main action key and is used to accomplish things such as open doors pick up objects you find use them and to start conversations with people
To open a door walk right up to it face it and press lt space gt
To talk to a character stand close to them and press lt space gt
The spacebar also uses inventory items
An example would be using the oilcan to fix the rusty grate
You retrieve the item from inventory press the lt I gt key to open inventory find the object lt enter gt to select it lt esc gt to return to the game face the grate and press lt space gt to actually use the object
If you are using an item on yourself you can be facing any direction
The Ctrl key fires weapons if you are hold one and casts a magic spell if you are not holding a weapon
The enter key toggles magic mode on and off At any point in the game you can press F for a list of command keys
Throughout the game you will acquire a few weapons and several magic spells
The main object of this game is to discover which combination of weapons and spells help you to survive most efficiently
If you find the most appropriate means of offense or defense it is possible to come through most situations uninjured or nearly so Do not put the arrow over the Save box in the upper right portion of the screen
This box is only the title of the screen not a button to push
Episode One Grave New World At the end of the opening movie you wind up stranded in a city years in the future
Pick up theNautilus use the spacebar to pick things up they go into your inventory automatically
On the lower left of the screen appears a Nautilus shell with two areas the outer white segments represent your Jad Garr l or the amount of raw energy you have
Each time you cast a spell or save a game you spend some of your Jad Garr l
This is unfortunate because it compels you to not save as often as you would like
Don't be too stingy though
It's vital to save
The inner green area is your Sand This represents your health and you lose it by being attacked
Keep an eye on this area when you are under attack
First it shrinks then it turns yellow warning and shrinks again then turns red Imminent death and shrinks rapidly
When it's gone you die and you must restart a saved game
I suggest hitting lt esc gt before you are really dead and you can get to the menu much more quickly
Go around the corner andtalk to the boy
Always exhaust all dialogue with all characters who will talk with you
He mentions wanting to trade but you don't have anything to trade right now
Go through the alley to the right into Hourglass City

The only one who will speak to you is the gardener
Everyone else is too busy to talk and they tell you to go see the priests

Practice each spell and talk to him again until you are sure he has nothing new to say You should also become familiar with the layout of the interior of the sphere you will enter several more spheres and they are all laid out the same
At times you will be in quite a hurry
After you cross the second bridge on the way to the final chamber look for a small cul de sac opposite the crystal formation Talk to the Lemur again on your way out
Go outside the sphere talk to the priest again and exit the temple Go left remember it looks like you are going right on the screen and find the second altar that is in the shadows go around to the left end of it and pick up theWrist Jadgar

Don't explore behind the Tripodon
You can get there but it is the Deadly Desert again
Descend walk up to the sign and read it spacebar listening to the six sounds
You see an inscription and above it six icons
The pictures represent the sounds you hear cycling only once through To hear them again step back and read the sign again
I found it helpful to go to the game options and turn themusic volume way down and the sound effects volume up a little
Otherwise they are easy to confuse because sometimes the musical sounds resemble the effects
The sounds are Nautilus wave of time Gong from the big hourglass Temple escaping steam Mine Entrance machinery Organ and Nautilus again
The idea behind crossing the bridge maze is to step on the proper sequence of transporters If you are exploring you have the option of walking down another staircase taking you to the mine entrance
There is nothing to do down here but it's worth the walk because you get a much better view of the Web of Time bridge maze Save your game here
The first platform you come to is the Nautilus
You will hear theWave soundas you step on it
Carefully step off the platform onto the wooden area one step at a time and listen
You are looking for the Gong sound
When you hear it you are going the right way
See those rising bubbles
They are transporters Beam Me Up
Walk ahead and be transported to the Gong platform
Don't hurry you'll misstep
Each time you arrive at a new platform you need togingerly test the exitsone step at a timeto find the right one
You must do it by ear
I cannot give you directions because the directions arerandomizedeach time you retry
Even if you fall through and re load a previously saved game the directions are changed
If you can't hear the sounds or tell them apart enlist the help of someone who can
Remember you started on Wave
The order from there isGong Steam Mine Organ and Waveagain
Oh and watch out for sounds that didn't appear on the sign
There is a musical honky tonk sound that some might mistake for the organ
Don't go there
There is also a quot Click quot sound
Don't go there either
Some people have a hard time distinguishing between the 'wave' nautilus sound and the 'mine' sound
They are very similar but the mine sound is about twice as long in duration
A word about the randomization
Apparently several of the game's variables are adjusted at random when you begin a new game
Inside the next area the Monastery you should find it easy going
There is a guard on the first floor who will talk with you and a Chronomancer near a big clock who is relatively friendly
If either of these characters attacks you without provocation the aggressiveness of your attackers will turn out to be more than you can handle
I suggest quitting and beginning a new game
The random difficulty factor affects many areas throughout the game and we haven't discovered them all yet
You can replay Episode one fairly rapidly if you need to now that you are familiar and the only real pain is crossing the Web of Time again
Cast the warp invisible spell on yourself BEFORE you take the last step to Wave and get your nautilus out of inventory and into your hand
When you arrive at the Monastery there is someone standing there
If he can see you he will shoot if you are invisible he won't
He is an illusion but his weapon inflicts real injury so don't just stand there
Just walk forward briskly and USE the Nautilus on him
He will disappear Go right in and look around
Like the Spheres the Monastery seems a lot bigger inside than outside
Once you're inside it's okay to turn the music volume back up if you lowered it to cross the maze
Read the informative panels on the wall You will find three stairway exits
One is guarded another takes you up to a catwalk and the first one you want to enter takes you into a factory like chamber called the Salt Processing Room
To find it start at the main entrance and walk to your right looks like left right
Take the first stairway you come to
Go in there turn left right and right and go up stairs to some worktables
Take theoil can
Go back down the stairs do not touch the copper machine up there you'll get an electric shock
Go back down the steps and talk to the Chronomancer Woman
She is a slave and does not have much to say
You can talk with the Chronomancer Monk in green If you show him inventory objects he will teach you about them
Do not attack him now
You could deharmonize him but that identifies you as being smarter and more aggressive than you are expected to be and will set up problems to come
Pick up theblack salt gemfrom the table at the foot of the stairs You can use it on yourself to regain Jad Garr l if you need to
And use the Ointment spell to recover your sand before you regain your Jad Garr l
If you poke around near the door there is a small passageway you can fit through but an adult cannot
Try it if you want but you can't get out the other end
Go back out to the main chamber down the steps and turn right Go back past the main entrance until you come another stairway not the one with the guards and enter
Go across the catwalk and into the area on the left
Do not talk to the monk and do not depress the lever yet
Go left behind the stairway and examine the duct grate near the floor
It needs oiling
If you go in you find that this is the other end of the passage in the Salt Room
You don't need to go in now but oil it so you can escape through here later
The Cylinder of Knowledge is here
It's the machine with a gramophone horn atop
Examine it repeatedly to learn some history
To the right of the Cylinder of knowledge is a D map of the sand world
Examine it to learn some geography
To the right of the entrance to this area is a table containing asand globe
Pick it up and use it if your sand green spiral is low
It will restore your sand points
Save it for later if your sand level is okay now
Don't forget you can cast the Hourglass spell on yourself to do the same thing using a little Jad Garr l in the process
Go back through the center area and into the sphere area
Look left and find a charged green hourglasson the table
It can increase your Jad Garr l or it can be traded for a spell
Go back to the center area and pull the lever just to the left of the catwalk you came in on
This starts up the clockwork
If you pulled it already the monk talked with you and you don't need to do it again just don't go into the sphere until you have done these other things The other uncharged hourglass can be charged now that you have turned on the chronomantic clocks
Use the hourglass on the clocks and it becomes activated
If you show the uncharged hourglass to the Monk he will tell you to use the clocks
You have two charged hourglasses
If your strength resources are very low you can use on hourglass on yourself
If you are still in the green you should wait
You will need to survive a couple of fights
The hourglasses will please the Lemur in the crystal
He trades spells for them
DO NOT touch the blue crystal near the sphere entrance
It unlocks the sphere and lets the Lemur out
You haven't befriended him yet and he will zap you
Go into the sphere and talk with the Lemur
There are three crystals to find but the first one you come to won't stand still
It jumps away when you try to touch it
Wander far back into the cave to find the other two
Cross the first bridge and pick up the quot Counterspell quot It's like an antidote when spells are cast against you
Go to the final chamber and get the quot Stop Time quot spell
It freezes moving objects and people
Use the spells on the Lemur to learn about them
It is important to know which spells are effective against various opponents
Cast the Stop Time Spell on the first prism to make it available
It is the quot Chronomantic Mask quot Practice it with the Lemur to see how it works If you wish you can trade another hourglass for a spell either the Grip of Khronos or Sand to Ashes would be a good choice
Or you can keep the hourglass for your own use
Your choice
SAVE YOUR GAME BEFORE YOU EXIT THE SPHERE
Chances are you will need to practice the next scenario a few times
When you go out converse with the monk after which there is an automatic sequence with Tetradon
He will try to kill you
Step towards the Chronomantic Lock the blue glowing crystal in the pole
Touch it to open the sphere and release the Lemur
The Lemur will fight Tetradon distracting him long enough for you to escape through the duct to the salt processing room
There is a good lesson here you can't defeat Tetradon yourself it's good to get others to fight him
If Tetradon attacked you enough to deplete your strength you might consider repeating the scene until you come through it with most of your resources left
You will need to fight the monk in the salt room
It would help to save again right after stepping out of the duct
Be ready to deharmonize the monk quickly
You could have attacked the monk earlier but it is much easier now because you canparalyze him with the stop time spell It is easier to approach him if you are invisible
Shoot him with the Wrist Jadgar
Go up the steps turn the wheel and turn around and jump into the mine car before it leaves without you
Tap the space bar to jump in
If you miss it another one will come
The new car will just sit there until you turn the wheel again
You will descend to the chasm
On the way down another Time Wave turns you into an old man and replenishes all your sand and Jad Garr l Episode Three Much work to do
Notice that your strength is automatically replenished
Find the stairs and go up ride the Tripodon back to the city
Talk to the Farmer who will take care of the Tripodon for you
Speak with him again until he offers to take you to the city gates
If you try to go alone you won't survive
You can speak to one of the guards on the way in
Head to Temple Square
Talk to the merchant woman
I think she is the same merchant as before made younger by the Time Wave
She has lost her sandscraper one of those little jumpy animals and implores you to find her some new sandscrapers
If you catch seven or more she will reward you
Be sure you notice her unique clothing before you make the deal with her so you can recognize her later
She is the one in the green scarf and yellow bottom skirt
Go behind her booth when she leaves and pick up some sand herbs Find the Priest and talk to him about the Memory Sanctuary and Vel Subek DO NOT go into the temple
Go to Hourglass City
Find the gardener and talk to him
You will learn about Hamiata and Ataimah sisters who live together
Go the far left end of the street and find a container ofMerthweed Leavessitting there
Take some
The Sandscraper hopping around Hourglass City is the hardest one to get
How to Stop him
Use a spell
Don't chase it stand still while it passes you then when it's nearly off the screen cast the spell
Go into the new road next to the original entrance
This is Crossroad an L shaped street
On the way in you will see a diagram on the pavement for playing a game called Rainbow Nautilus
The boy walking around Hourglass City will play this game with you
Do it later you have work to do
Proceed into the street and see the sandscraper behind a little fence
Put some merthweed down for it to feed
It steps forward and you can pick it up
Go a little further and a boy walks out of a doorway
He is too busy to talk
Go into the doorway and talk to the crying girl
The boy took her doll and lost it
It's up to you to get it back
Explore the area around the corner of the Crossroad
You will find several wooden crates and a special plant called ahoney cactusaround the corner
Cut a piece of the cactus with your knife
If you didn't trade for the knife in Episode one you need to go to Hamiata's house now
She lives in an alley in the U shaped street where you originally talked to the boy in the first scene
Go there talk with her and take her knife
You will have several scenes in the game where you need to use the wooden crates to accomplish your purpose
To move a crate walk up close to it and hold the spacebar
This makes you grab onto the crate
Then you can push it forward with the up arrow or pull it back with the down arrow holding the space bar down during the process
Most of the time after moving a crate you will want to climb on it
To climb walk up close to it and tap the spacebar once quickly You need to rearrange the crates in order to climb over the wall
Climb up on the big dark crate furthest to the left
Pull the large light colored crate towards you
Climb over it and jump down on the other side of this crate
Push it completely to the left
The reason for moving the top crate is so you can get the middle one out of the bottom row
Get down and pull out the light colored crate in the middle
You can ignore all the other crates now
Push this crate tight against the right hand wall and climb upon it
Then climb over the wall
You will find a Tripodon pen
The doll is in there on the ground
The Tripodon won't let you take it because he is hungry
Put some cactus heart in his trough and he is content
Take the doll and return it to the little girl who lives in the same alley where the crates are
Talk to her give her the doll and she gives you anEffahid Flutein return YOU MUST GET THE FLUTE It is possible to get out of Episode three without it but you can't survive Episode Six if you don't have it
Pick up theSand Herbson the window sill
Pick up theuncharged hourglasson the other window sill
While you are in Hourglass Square you can visit a sculptor who is working near the city center
If you examine her work there are errors in the spelling
Pick up thechiseland correct the work
She rewards you with asalt gem
As you walk aound Hourglass square a boy entreats you to play agame of Rainbow Nautilus
He will take either the chisel or your compass as a bet
If you win the game you getSand herbs
When you begin the game he offers to explain the rules to you
Be sure you are not holding an object in your hand if you want to get the rules
Otherwise he accepts the trade and play starts automatically
It is not required to play this game but it's not difficult and gets you some herbs to help replenish your health later
You can do this at any time as long as you have something worth trading
Note from a player If you score or more in Rainbow Nautilus the boy says something like quot Wow that score is too good for sand herbs quot and instead gives you a charged hourglass
Three pointers and one pointer will do it
To aim look at the ground below the ball going back and forth There will be two dark specks right next to each other If you are going for a point shot letting go just to the right of quot between quot them will work with the power indicator just touching the orange For the pointer you must release exactly as the ball goes over the right hand 'speck' with the indicator at around the th or th quot rivet quot on the side of the indicator thing
Once you have played once you can practice this if you want or need the hourglass but I have not figured a way to get to play anyone on the other rainbow nautilus gameboard
Thanks Josh Go to Crossroad the T shaped street on the far left of Hourglass Square
On your way over there stop at theMerthweedcontainer and get some more
Go into the Crossroad and notice another Rainbow Nautilus game on the steeet
Go to the T intersection and turn right
If there is a man in the dead end alley he tells you need to find the Hierarch's seal
He may not be there
There is anotherhoney cactusto the left of the door
Take some
There is a sandscraper atop the crate
Use another crate to get up there While you are in Crossroad go into the other end and find the old woman at the pump
She is Ataimah
Talk to her about her bad back
The pump isn't working correctly and she has to carry heavy buckets
You need to repair the pump
Pull the lever down to start the pump
It's leaking
Go around the left side of the machine and turn the wheel space left arrow
You don't need to hold the control down Wales knows how far to turn it
Then go around front again
Find theadjustable spanner called a pipe wrench in the US and use it on the leaking pipe
Go turn the wheel to the left again
Back around front grab the left hand crate and pull it out
Now you can get to the new leaking pipe and fix it
Talk to the woman again
Her back isn't any better but the plumbing works now and she is grateful enough to give youone of the two keysyou need to unlock the box in Hamiata's house
To get the other key you need to dry the fresh merthweed leaves and make tea for Hamiata
The place to dry them is in Prison Square
Find it by going back to the original entrance
There are guards here and you should stay close to the walls
Go around to the right until you find a large metal plate with nuts drying on it
Place the leaves on the tray and wait
You can hear them sizzling
The merthweed is dried when the noise stops and you see it turn brown
Pick it back up
A sandscraper is walking in the prison yard easy to pick up
If you decide to talk to the guards one will tell you to get lost the other is in a really bad mood because he was deharmonized by some kid
That was you in Episode One
Let's free that prisoner
Talk with the prisoner if you like
It turns out he was arrested for stealing a Tripodon
So he is being tortured for something you did
It's only fair to try to help him
Go stand underneath the stairs between the guards and the prisoner
You will hear them talking
Get the Warp invisibility spell ready andSave Your Game
Go up to the prisoner's platform
Straight ahead is a console with two levers
The left hand lever activates the electric shock to torture the prisoner
The right hand lever straight ahead turns off the power to the shocker
Turn off the power do not shock the prisoner
He will scream and draw attention to you
Go to the right side of the platform and find three levers
Pull the first one down once and pull the other two down twice
Then turn the wheel to the left space left arrow
Hurry
When the guard says he will quot freshen up quot he will come to the fountain for a drink see you and


Zap
You can avoid getting zapped if you must make yourself invisible two or three times
Another option is wait to free the prisoner until you have traded seven sandscrapers for the Tuning Fork
To use the Fork put it in your hand and press the spacebar
You will hear a tone and see the icon appear at the bottom of the window
It lasts for one minute and protects you from attack
After you ring the Fork you can put it away so you can handle levers etc
Probably the best of both worlds is to use Warp once then the Fork to escape
Here's another method You have enough time to push one or two levers when you hear the guard say quot freshen up quot there's enough time to jump off the platform
If the guard sees you in the prison yard not standing on the platform you won't get attacked
Just go back and forth pulling the levers one at a time until the prisoner is free
One player reports being able to talk to the prisoner after he is free by standing near the sack just before entering the square where Hamiata's house is
Now you can go to Hamiata and make her some cactus merthweed tea
Find the teapot put in the leaves and the honey cactus
If you leave out the cactus she doesn't like it
It's too bitter
If you leave out the merthweed and only put in the cactus she finds it too sweet
If you gave her a taste of either bitter or sweet tea just fix it by adding the missing ingredient to the teapot
It's not necessary to go back and get more merthweed or cactus
When you get it just right she gives you thesecond key
Open the chest and take theHierarch's Seal
Here's where seven of the sandscrapers are The eighth animal is in the Sanctuary of Memory square just trotting around
If you need this one because you couldn't capture the one that runs away be sure to exit the square and trade it to the merchant before you go see Vel Subek inside his sanctuary
TheMerchantwho wants the sandscrapers will not be at the market when you go back she is walking around Temple Square and is hard to find
A good way to stop her is to run past her and wait until she walks near you and hit the spacebar
Test theTuning Forkwhen you get it so you know how to use it when you are under pressure
Optional Remember the kid near Hamiata's house that traded with you in Episode One
He is there again and is the same boy who lost the little girl's doll
He will exchange some Vissahid ointment for the bucket
If you give Ataimah the ointment she will think you are a hero but gives you nothing in trade except perhaps some good advice about oiling some wheels Go to the second crossroad past the water pump you repaired andring the bellby the red door You may have to ring it three or four times because the guard inside is hard of hearing The guard wants to see your seal
Show him and go into the Sanctuary of Memory square
Learn the layout now you will be in a hurry to get out later
Go through the grey doors into the sanctuary
Touch the doors to open them and step in promptly
If you wait until the doors close
You can't open them a second time Be sure you have done everything elseyou want to in Episode Three before you go into the sanctuary this episodeends automaticallywhen you exit the Sanctuary
Look around
There is a table with asand globeandblack salt gemfor you to take
If you have an uncharged hourglass you can charge it at the clock
Talk to Vel Subek
He won't speak to you until you show him your Nautilus
Read thescrollson the library wall
There is animportant clueabout the Lemurs weakness in one scroll
The higher ones can be accessed by using the steps
The wheels squeak and need to be oiled
The readable scrolls are the gray ones harder to see than the parchments
Read the scroll near the entrance carefully it contains animportant cluefor a later episode
Be sure to talk again to Vel Subek until he wishes you well and has no more to say
Show him your inventory items to gain some information
Enter the Sphere to learn two new spells Voyage of the Arch and Veil of the Nautilus
The Veil of the Nautilus is in the far rear
Pick it up first and go back to the Lemur to practice
He shows you how it protects against the loss of Jad Garr l whether from attacks or through the singing of certain creatures
Remember his advice
Since the Lemur wants to keep the Voyage of the Arch spell he hides the real prism among three fake ones
It's anillusion
If you touch one of these fake prisms you will lose some health
So cast an Eye of Jad Garr l spell or use yourNautilusand you will see the fake prisms disappear
Exit the sphere and leave the Sanctuary an automatic scene unfolds where you are arrested Episode Four Get out of Jail You are in prison with Ashamira
Speak to her until a Time Wave occurs and you are both changed into children The guard has stepped away for a moment and dropped hiskeyby the door
You have very little time
Pick up the key unlock the door and exit to your right
Go into the cell two doors down by unlocking it
Watch the guard return and go into your former cell to search
To exit your new cell you must put the key away lt zero gt or you will lock yourself in
Exit to the left walk promptly to your old cell get out the key and lock the guard inside
This scene is easier if you assign a hotkey to the key
An alternative to locking the guard in your cell is to take his key and wait until he comes back to stand guard
You can use the deharmonizer spell or the Wrist Jadgar and shoot him in the back
Still another alternative is to exit the cell and use the invisibility spell when the guard comes back
if you stay invisible the other guards will come to this place and the guardroom will be empty
Stay invisible and go to the guard room
Upon entering turn right and pull the lever to close the gate immediately
OR go back past your hiding place and through the door by the bell into the next cellblock
Go up to the first cell you come to and unlock it
The child imprisoned there turns out to be the man you freed from the torture machine
His memory needs to be restored
Give him a black salt crystal
He has a plan to help
He will distract the guards for you
The boy rings the bell summoning the guards from their ready room
You must wait until the guards Inspect the Cells Then exit go to the guardroom turn right and pull the lever to close the gate
Now you really haven t much time
Suggest you save immediately the following scene is hard to survive until you have practiced it a few times
Position yourself near Ashamira
If you stand behind Ashamira her shield will protect you Get the Stop Time spell ready and cast it on the woman when she enters
Immediately get the Deharmonizer Spell ready and walk toward the woman zapping her
If you are close enough twice should do it
An alternative is to become invisible and let Ashamira do the dirty work
Take stock of your life resources
If you don t have about half of your Jad Garr l left you can t make it through the next part
In that case go back to your saved game and get through this scene more efficiently
There are four doors in the guardroom
Exit the door to the far right not the one the woman came through that exit leads to hourglass square and certain death
Get the invisible spell ready and use it as soon as Ashamira exits
Run to the crates
Push the crate to the left just far enough to clear the other crates then push it through the door
Near the end of the pushing process you will be shielded by the other crates or by the wall and the guards stop shooting at you
Once you clear the door you are safe for a while
You and Ashamira need to find a way out of this enclosure without going back into the yard where the guards are
Push the crate against the other nearby crates and climb all the way up to the roof
Ashamira will follow you
Go jump on the lift platform
That is walk up to it and tap space
She will automatically hoist you up
Go across the roof and jump across the gap to the other roof and touch the plank
The plank is now a bridge
Go back to the two crates and cut the rope
Bring the crate you can only move one of them across the bridge and push it up against the abutment at the far right hand end so you can climb onto the next roof
Touch the new plank on the far side of it and it makes a bridge that is too short
Push the big crate onto the end of the plank to hold it down
Climb over the crate to the plank jump to the gatehouse and turn the wheel
Ashamira rides up
Get on the lift she lowers you
Now go get the original crate you brought with you it's a long walk and put it on the lift
She brings you and the crate up
Take the crate off the lift and turn the wheel again to lower the lift and bring up the weight Put the crate on the counterweight
Now there is enough weight to cause the appartus to descend and you all escape
Go find the Tripodon
He won t have anything to do with you because he is thirsty
Fill your bucket with water and pour the water in the trough
Willoughby is happy now and will take you to the Rebel Camp
Episode Five In the Rebel Camp Talk to everyone
Do Not Head Away From The Camp Into the Desert As in Episode One the Lemurs are out there and will put you to an unmerciful end
The Tripodon keeper will tell you things and give you a nip of Ash Fire when you show him some cactus
Dahjaroun the man working at a table is suspicious of you but he feels better after you recharge his wrist Jadgar
Talk to him more and he gives you aSounding Stick
Go into the big tent and no wonder Ashamira said she could help you find the arch it s in her tent
Turns out she s in charge of things around here
Talk to her pick up thesalt gems fire up thearch and step through
Cast the Voyage of the Arch spell on the arch
If you don't want to spend the Jad Garr l on a spell the Nautilus will also turn on the Arch
Stand in the Circular area to activate the Arch with the Nautilus Episode Six Watch your step
No Toto this doesn t quite look like Kansas more like the Deadly Desert
You need to cross this expanse Use the Sounding Stick and don t ever step past the area cleared by the stick
Listen to your footsteps
When they sound mushy don't go any further
Test the ground with the stick
When you come to a canyon with a gravel floor you can put away the stick Go to the rock wall with a hole in it and observe the Lemur on the other side
You will need to crawl through the hole Put away all inventory and press lt space gt and deal with the Lemur
Play your flute to calm him down
Suggestion The following scenes are difficult indeed
The first Lemur will be charmed by the flute but the second one which you encounter while trying to climb the ledge will attack you mercilessly and you must kill him before he does you in If you have not been using the hotkey feature yet this is the time for it
Put the flute on a hotkey so you can get to it immediately Put the wrist Jadgar on a hotkeyas well
Remember to play the flute hit the hotkey then the space
To fire the Wrist Jadgar hit its hotkey then the Ctrl
key
You can also put spells on a hotkey perhaps one to shield yourself and one to slow down the lemur
The invisible spell doesn t fool them nor does the Stop Time Spell have any effect
You ve heard of Shake n Bake or Surf n Turf right
Well this isFlute n Shoot
If you are quick and careful you can get rid of this one without losing any powers
The technique is to still him with the flute fire the Jadgar then immediately flute again
After you dispatch the nasty Lemur you can climb over the next set of ledges
Down to earth again and look carefully
There is an object right there in the path but hard to see
TheShell of Timeis good for restoring your Jad Garr l Before you enter the Lemurs' Lair save your game Choice You can flute the first three Lemurs but don t dawdle
They will not only shoot at you they will cast a spell that drains you away
Watch out for a red glow that looks like a funnel over your head
If that happens escape to a saved game
It drains your sand until you are dead
If you are really agile and not too close to the Lemur throwing a spell at you you might be able do dodge lt alt gt left or right and not get hit
You can also run lt shift gt
You can use the counterspell that cancels out spells put on you but only if you survive long enough to use it I decided to kill the first two
That way you don t have to deal with them on the way back out You will come to a chasm which is really an illusion
In previous spheres there was a bridge there
Fix the illusion with theEye of Jad Garr lspell and you can cross the bridge
Don t take too long the Lemur over your shoulder doesn t stay charmed forever
Past the chamber on the other side of the bridge there will be a cluster of crystals on the right side
Across from the crystals there is an alcove on the left which is difficult to see
Turn in there and pick up theChronophorefrom the floor Go further and charm the last Lemur the Old Woman of the Caverns
Charm her again go behind and steal thecharged hourglass
Put the flute away in order to pick something else up
Don't bother to offer the hourglass in trade she is not interested
Put the Hourglass away get the flute back out charm her again then put the flute away and talk
Note be sure to continue the conversation space before she finishes the first long speech
It helps to have the captions turned on
It seems if you allow her to finish her speech you will be unable to restart the conversation
Keep talking to her until she gives you theSpectral Body Spell
Then she won t attack you when you leave
After you leave her don t return or she will have a change of heart and throw a deadly spell at you If you left any Lemurs alive on the way in the best technique is touse the spectral body spell and run past themso quickly they don t have time to do you harm Whew
Go down the canyon ignoring the Lemurs on the way
Hop from rock to rock playing the flute in between each hop
Go to the far right to pick up theCrystal Flask
Be very careful to face the right way when jumping off this rock and the next one
It is possible to fall into the chasm
You probably should shoot the Lemur who attacks you
You can do this before getting the flask just don't leave it behind
You can get past him by playing the flute between each jump but you need to be precise for each jump
It s hard to make headway because you must be standing on exactly the right spot each time you want to hop
If you have been there and done that enough times to memorize the route you can make it out of there solely on your charm
I preferred to zap the bugger
Don't bother to restore your health now a Wave is near and you will be fully healed Have the Veil of the Nautilus Spellreadybefore you go near the ocean
Go to the end and climb down
Stay close to the wall work your way around to the right in between two pillars and find anotherShell of Time
Pick it up and watch the automatic sequence
If you get too close to the water before finding the Shell you can t get back to it
It's not a big problem if you miss it
Take the crystal flask to the spot on the beach and fill it Look for the spot at the farthest right you can go
If you found the shell go up screen
It's near the waterline and near the cliff You must fill the flask
If you miss it now you get a second chance in episode Episode Seven Home again You are an adult again
Cast theVeil of the NautilusSpell on yourself as soon as possible
The mermaids song will do you harm if you don't use this spell
Remember the Sirens of mythology
Go the Mermaid in the center of the scene show her the flask and talk to her
She will agree to help you and gives you theConch of Khronos
If you missed filling the flask before the Mermaid came do it now before you take the Conch
Take the Conch and watch the automatic sequence
You blow a note on the Conch causing a wave
It affects the guards and the rebels are unhurt
The conch turns to sand and it s time to go to work Episode Eight Ready for Battle Head for the temple
Suggestion Save your game at the beginning of this episode
You will have a tough battle in the Temple and will want to practice your strategy
Avoid the battles on the way through town Use the Spectral Body spell to slip through the town unscathed
As you come to the entrance of Temple Square you will see Ashamira engaged in a fight
Make yourself invisible and go past them
Enter the temple
Vaporize the Chronomancer as soon as possible
You will need to use the Chronophore or the Wrist Jadgar on him
If you couldn t find a Chronophore in the Lemurs cave there is one on the far side of the big altar in the temple
Cast Warp on yourself to become invisible so you can get to the Chronophore
He is tough to beat
One way is to stay invisible until you can get right up close to him and cast the Stop Time spell
Then shoot
It is more effective to fire the Chronophore slowly and deliberately because each time you fire it it discharges twice One thing to watch for is when you enter the room you can't see the Chronomancer yet but if you hear him cast a protective spell on himself sounds like drawing a sword load your game again
You can't spell him if he's protected
Here's an alternate Easier way to beat the Chronomancer when you enter the temple walk straight ahead to the altar
Look for the crack in the altar and stand right there
The altar will absorb all the weapon fire and spells and you will be safe
Use the wrist Jadgar to shoot in the direction of the Chronomancer
You can't see him but you can hear when your shots strike
He is shielded at first but eventually you will get him
Thanks 'Odin' for finding this method
After the Chronomancer is toast you can relax until you leave the temple
Talk to the Effahid
He just happens to be the deaf guard from the sanctuary
He will give you thekey to the red door the same one where you needed the Seal before Walk around to the far back of the room and try what looks like a back door
Something strange here
Erase theillusionand get a charged hourglass for your efforts
If you were exploring carefully back in Episode One you found this strange spot but couldn t do anything about it unless you were clever enough to try the Nautilus on it
Or you might have found it in Episode Three when you shouldn't have been in the temple anyway and got zapped for your efforts
Find theBlack Salt Gemand theChronophoreon the altar
If you already have a Chronophore leave this one
You don't need two
Go to Vel Subek s Sanctuary
Out the Temple door and head right into the first alley
You will need to get by the guard at the red door
The same technique invisible stop time shoot works pretty well
Inside the walls are two more Shekandars who have nothing better to do than shoot at you
If you are invisible and if you know the way you can get past them and into the Sanctuary door unscathed
Vel Subek will talk to you and reveal something When he is done talking explore
You can find sand crystals salt globes an hourglass in the small bookcase and if you position the stairs correctly a Vapor Thrower on top of the large bookcase at the right hand end Optional You can go into the sphere and talk with the lemur
He will trade theAccelerationSpell for an hourglass
It speeds you up
Go to the city gates and see the machine
Out of the alley go left and take the first road toward Hourglass Square
Don t step into it
Go back and see Vel Subek
He created the Cyclops and will help you to destroy it
Approach the machine with Vel Subek
Use your adjustable spanner to open the central panel of the machine
Put the wrench away pull out the middle cable which releases Ashamira from the paralyzing field
Go to the palace gates beyond the Hourglass where you will find Ashamira engaged in battle with the guards
She can t quite pull it off without your help
Make yourself invisible go up the steps and paralyze and shoot the guard who is not fighting
Then do the same with the other one
Wait until the guards are actively firing at Ashamira
If you go too soon they both concentrate on you
Enter the throne room by pulling the levers together with Ashamira
She shows you how
The Heirarch is in there and he is one tough dude
His only desire is to eliminate you
It turns out the best way to get the better of him is the lesson you learned before
Run away from him lurking in the shadows for a while
Ashamira will fight him while protecting herself She keeps the Heirarch occupied while you can sneak up and use the Chronophore
Three or four good shots should do it
When he vaporizes you can relax for the time being
Pick up theblack salt gemon the table if you didn t already get it while Ashamira was doing your dirty work
Go into the sphere where there is an unpleasant but harmless Lemur
If you try to take the spells he transports you out
Carry the quartz flask with you and the Lemur is repelled
Two good spells TheMermaids Songto cause your opponent to be insane works on Lemurs and theChronomantic Armorto cancel spells cast by your opponent
You could go into the sphere while Ashamira is fighting
The Chronomanntic Armor can give you some protection when you exit and join the battle
Now to findUlmoreth he is trapped behind the secret door
Examine the four statues with hourglasses Turn over each hourglass once only You need to activate them in the correct order
The clue comes from the scroll near the entrance to Vel Subek's Sanctuary of Memory
The order is Woman Old Man Child Shekandar
Woman Adhamid is left of the entrance just right of the rear of the sphere
Old Man Vissahid is the next one to the right of the entrance
Child Effahid is to the right of the throne and left of the sphere and Shekandar is left of the throne between there and the Vissahid
The secret door is behnid the table where the black salt gem was
Here are the images in sequence The secret door will open
Go in and talk to Ulmoreth ultimately to exit and talk to Vel Subek
You will return to the Mine Monastery area Episode Nine In the Mines The key lets you into the mine entrance
When you step forward you see the sequence with the Chronomancer woman and a worker after which she attacks you immediately
You must have a strategy in place
The new Chronomantic Armor spell protects you allright but it only lasts two or three seconds and costs a whopping two and a half Jad Garr l points
The stop time also delays her but not for long
It will be a fight
You might try the Tuning Fork
Two players have sent suggestions for this sequence Odin's advice quot Here I used the vapour thrower in the salt processing room Shekandar in the control room guard in the organ room Shekandar I assigned it to key and Chronophore to key
Move quickly and not straight thus avoiding the spells the Chronomancer fires at you when you are near her press and so on she should be harmless
If you are quick you can get out of it with no loss of Jad Garr l and health quot SS Posey's advice Upon entering the mine immediately pull out your Chronophore
Half hide beside the wall protrusion just as you enter and fire from safety
I killed her without getting hit at all quot Don t go look at the robot you can see it in the movie so you know where not to go
Go to the controls and the furthest one straight ahead gives you control of the robot
It is standing on the bridge and must be moved back
Press space to take control of the robot then the down arrow to move it back
The control nearest the entrance controls the bridge The middle one which the woman turned off is the power to the mine cars and lifts
We need to destroy the robot so do this back up the robot so it is not standing on the bridge
Retract the bridge
Move the robot forward until it falls over the bridge into the mine
Turn the power back on
Watch carefully and you will see a mine car get stuck
It is on this same level the middle of three levels
Put the bridge back and cross it looking around to the left go behind that stuck mine car until you find the lift
Take it downstairs find the smashed robot examine it and retrieve theDisrupter
Talk to Semireth
He gives you a clue how to get to the Monastery
A mine car could help
Remember the Salt Processing Room
Take the lift up to the third level with the disrupter ready
Use it immediately on the robot so it doesn t attack
Go across to the controls put the robot on the lift and take it back to the second floor
Now exit the lift to your right find the gap in the guard rail and wait for a conveyor
Hop on and ride to the third floor
Don t forget to turn around so you are facing the floor lest you jump into the abyss
Jump off control the robot to push the mine car
Now things are moving again
Call the lift with the red button and take it to the bottom floor
Press down again when it pauses at the middle level Take a conveyor to the second floor and jump into the mine car
Don t forget to turn toward the car
You will ride to the salt processing room
Quickly turn left and press space to get out of the car or the Chronomancer will use the gas on you
The monk in the Green robe is there
If he fights you zap him
There is aBlack Salt Gemon the table
Go around the elevated area past the small passageway and into the control station
Look for the silver doors
Zap the warrior before he gets to you
Play with the control stations
The one straight in from the door only arouses your curiosity
The one to your left is a surveillance station and gives you more views than you have had before
Notice how the mini prison walls are lowered
Be sure to watch carefully when Tetradon controls the robot
Use the four arrow keys to move your surveillance view
Press Esc
to quit the view
The machine to your back is the control for the transporter maze
Activate it to repair the Web of Time
If you have observed the maze carefully you found that it is constructed in the shape of a nautilus
The maze is rebuilt and Ashamira and the Rebels cross the maze
A Time Wave occurs and you are old
You can pick up anotherSalt Gembefore you leave the processing room
Go back to the Chronomancer s room and walk into one of the transporter beams
You are challenged to a duel where all your weapons are deactivated and you must use only spells to fight
You should get the first shot
Stop time him ASAP put on your armor and deharmonize him
It is possible to survive with your powers intact
There is aSand Globeon a table near the sphere and aBlack Salt Gemon the table near the interactive map
After this battle go up the stairs near the passageway you escaped into before into the control pulpit and take control of the robot
Send the robot around the other side where Ashamira is occupied fighting the other robot
Make your robot attack the other one press Ctrl
Both robots blow up
Make your way down to Ashamira
She and Ulmoreth will be fighting two guards
You can hang back until they deharmonize both guards
Then they head for the Organ Room door
Talk to Ulmoreth and Ashamira
Go into the organ room
You enter and see Tetradon control aflying robotto entrap Ulmoreth
You step forward and Tetradon also traps Ashamira
You must find the controls to the robot
Go straight ahead through the area where Tetradon s pulpit is and run around the metal catwalk until you find the entrance to the room where the Shekandar is apparently controlling the robot
Deharmonize him
If you can't manage t deharmonize him just use the Spectral Body Spell to avoid injury
In each of the four corners there is a robot control
You must get to each corner and activate the lever without getting hit by the robot s ray
Creep along the walls
The sequence is unimportant
The robot is finished and Tetradon reappears
Armor yourself or protect with the Spectral Body Spell before he attacks you and go to Ulmoreth s trap and turn the wheel to free him
lt space left arrow gt When you release Ulmoreth Tetradon hides in a secret room and you will have to figure out how to open the passage to the room
The key is playing notes on the organ in the correct sequence
You get some clue by listening as he plays the notes then watching as the secret door opens which two levers had been pulled
Go to the circular area across from the robot control room The three levers control the organ s functions
The keyboards are the big semicircles
Don t worry you don t have to be musical here just select the five notes in the right order Do this as you approach the organ area the three control levers are all up
Put the center one and the right one down
Then let s call the right semicircle A and the left one B
Go to the right half of A closest to you and play the note once
Go to the left half of A and play the note once
Turn around and go to the left half of the B side again closest to you and play the note twice
Then to the right half of B and play once
The door should open
If you goof up start over by cycling the control levers
Here's a picture Inside the room is an arch decorated with eleven pyramid shaped holes
Around the perimeter of the room are fourteen busts with pyramids above
Therefore three must be booby trapped
To place a pyramid in the arch just go touch it
To avoid being injured by the traps protect yourself with the Spectral Body spell
Activate the arch by going around the back side of it and casting the arch spell or using the Nautilus
You are back on the beach Episode Ten Watch your Back Talk to the Mermaid
She gives you theFoam Keyand some advice and leaves with Ulmoreth
Before you leave be sure you have filled the flask with water
The place to get it is on the far right just at the edge of the water
If you managed to fill it in Episode Six it is still full
Pick up theShell of Timenear the place where you fill the flask
Go through the pillars
You and Ashamira are in a cavern
Right behind you is anotherShell of Time
Explore the perimeter until you find a stone lever in the wall just to the left of the stairs
When you approach the stairs or if you attempt to pull the lever Tetradon Logor Shar appears and Ashamira is cornered by a pair of Lemurs
Tetradon tells you he wants that key
Give it to him
Unfortunately he uses it in the wrong keyhole and joins the Sands of Time As soon as you are able to move go onto the platform
You cannot be attacked while you are standing there
Cast the Spectral Body spell on yourself rendering yourself invulnerable to attack Runand operate the lever closing one quarter of the door to the Lemurs nest
Return to the Pillars and wait for the Spell to wear off
Cast the Spectral Body spell again andrunto the second lever that appears
The second one is on the left wall near the far end of the room
If you are slow or wander around cast the spell again
Return to the Pillars and wait again for the spell to dissipate
Cast the spell and close the third lever this time on the right wall near the other end of the room
Return to the pillars let the spell wear off and cast it one last time
Close the fourth lever which is on the left wall right where Tetradon was standing
Return to the pillars
If you need one there is aShell of Timebehind the pillars
Here's where you have a choice to make
Ashamira seems to be gone deharmonized by the Lemurs
However if you destroy all the Lemurs she will reappear quot reminded quot she calls it
So the choice is you can simply take the Foam Key and discover which is the correct pillar and forget about Ashamira or you can bring her back from the 'Sands' and take her with you into the next episode
It is thebetter endingto have her with you Stay on the platform and use the Chronoeider to shoot the Lemurs
If you were efficient in closing the gates there will only be three
There may be more if you were slow but it doesn't matter
Some of them will probably hang back near the gates and will be hard to see until you step forward a little
As long as you stay on the top step they can't hurt you Thanks to quot Lone Wolf quot for discovering the method of remaining on the platform
When Ashamira reappears talk to her
She has lost all her memory
How to get it back
Trying a Black Salt gem doesn't seem to work
Aha
The Flask filled with water from the Sea of Eternity
That restores her memory and she is ready to go with you
In the pillars Tetradon had been fooled by anillusion
Retrieve theFoam Keythat Tetradon left in the wrong keyhole
Use the Nautilus and you will see an effect on the correct pillar
Use the Foam Key on that pillar and be transported to the Sanctuary of Khronos
Episode Eleven The Final Conflict There is aShell of Timeon the barrel
Talk with Ashamira about the meaning of the room you are in
Examine the clock with the quartz hand
Also examine the plans on the drafting table
Go up the steps to inspect the Chronoeider
Uh Oh Tetradon Logor Shar appears in the form of a Lemur
As soon as the conversation ends and you can move hide behind the Chronoeider Thanks again to Lone Wolf for this idea Use the Chronophore to fire from your hiding place
Here's a tip While you are exploring the sanctuary Ashamira changes position several times Wait until she goes up the stepsto the Chronoeider then go there with her and touch the Chronoeider
That way when the fight begins she will be at your side
Observe her as she shoots at Logar Shar and she aims in different directions
Change your aim slightly to match hers
After you both hit him together a few times
It is over
If you used this technique you may have come through the whole scene without any injury
If she is not visible don't worry she is attacking him even if you can't see her
When Logor Shar evaporates talk to Ashamira
When you move back to the Chronoeider Khronos himself appears
Talk to him
Listen to the entire dialogue it's the whole point of the story
At the end you are invited to destroy Khronos in order to save the Universe
Khronos is easily defeated he has no power but the Chronoeider tries to defend him
It's not very sporting but the way to not be injured is to move around behind Khronos stand at the foot of the stairway and shoot him in the back
The Chronoeider cannot hit you from there
Ashamira will join the void she cannot come to London with you
Go back to the Chronoeider and the automatic scene unfolds Don't wait aroundtoo long before returning to the Chronoeider or you will also end up in the void
For a special treat be sure towatch the credits

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
TITANIC Adventure Out of Time Solution by Lu Richardson Written for Cheet Sheets Magazine General tips When the game starts it's a good idea to choose the Tour rather than playing straight away
This will allow you to learn to use the interface and it will also familiarize you with the ship and how to move about it you are going to do an awful lot of that
The important thing is to remember to look carefully all around you by turning on the spot and to interact with everything you can
You could miss something important if you failed to do this and even when items are not pertinent to the game they are still a visual treat
As the manual indicates you can get an awful lot of help from the Stewart the Elevator Operator and the Purser as well as the character named Trask
In order to keep this solution as brief as possible I will take it for granted that you will talk to the Stewart on the mechanics of the game that you will consult the Elevator Operator whenever you need to go anywhere just ask him for directions that you will go to the Purser and find out where everyone is to be found write a list of everyone's cabin it will save you no end of time and that you will take each item you find to Trask
Talk to everyone you meet click on every human figure you see
Use up every option
Sometimes you need to click on them again to talk some more
When choosing a given line is important I will say so
This game is event driven rather than time driven so take it leasurely it's well worth investigating everything as you go along
There is more than one way to go about solving certain problems and this in fact makes the game more complicated than it need be people keep sidetracking you which is rather confusing and it's all rather disjointed the more so because you can do things in any order you like
Here I will give you the most direct solution Certain details change every time you play the game so if events don't take place exactly as I describe them please try other strategies
For instance some people seem to have a mind of their own and turn up in different places every time you play so if you need to speak to someone and they are not there don't panic
Go looking for them elsewhere
I hope this solution will help it's main purpose is to give you a rough idea as to what to do
It's up to you how you do it
Oh and yes Save your game often LONDON Explore the room and try everything

When you do start examining it read all the postcards clicking on them turns them over the notes in the drawer and also click on the watch These are most important things
When you've finished with the desk a bomb will drop on the house and there will be a short clip to watch before you turn up at your cabin in the TITANIC Again have a look around
Open the door when the Stewart knocks and get all the info he can give you You will also get a card from P P

Click on the girl to talk to her and receive her directives
Afterwards look around some of the machines can be used
Leave the gymnasium by going straight out onto the Boat Deck
Go aft and talk to Georgia she will give you her necklace
Ask about Sasha
Head for the Wireless Room until you hear someone calling you The Wireless Room At this point you could take a shortcut by ignoring him and going on to the Wireless Room
Attempt to enter it and Officer Morrow intercepts you
It is important that you choose the following lines when talking to him quot The sea appears calm quot quot It's a clear night but dark quot quot What uproar quot quot You don't care for burocrats quot quot What war was that quot quot No wonder moonless nights make you jumpy quot quot Now may I visit the wireless room quot After this he will invite you to do so

Agree to go with him and you meet Zeitel and Haderlitz Converse with them until they all go then click on the table to the right to get Zeitel's pipe
Examine the Cafe for a bit of fun
Leave and you'll meet Daisy Cashmore you gives you a lot of info and asks a favour of you
Go upstairs and to the Smoking Room to meet Seidelmann who will introduce you to Riviera
You can have a few games of Blackjack if you like
How to get the book Leave and go to the Great Staircase in A Deck and talk to Trask
Show him the pipe he suggests you go to the Turkish Bath
Do so
Inside click on the fountain click on the spout and leave the water running
Go to the mirror and click on it
You get a message
Go to P P though you needn't talk to her if you don't want to and go down the stairs all the way to the Turbine Room
Go in and go downstairs
Have a look there are some valves here that you can activate but I am not sure if this has an effect on the Control Room or not
Just a thought
At any rate you'll be coming back here later on in the game
Go back up the stairs and along to the Control Room Enter it and attempt to enter the Engine Room
The seaman won't let you but he has trouble with the turbine
Offer to help
Look at the controls and exit i e click on quot OK quot talk to the seaman and ask for advice
He will show you the manual
Make a note of the instructions exit say you'll have another bash and at the controls follow the instructions exactly till you get the needle in the green zone
Now you can go through to the Engine Room
Have a good look around because you'll be coming back then go through to Boiler Rooms and where you'll meet Vlad
Talk to him and agree to help him
Go down the stairs behind him and examine Coal Shute by clicking on it
Retrieve the book move to Coal Shute and hide the book by placing it in the box
Go up the stairs again and into the Engine Room you can take a short cut up the stairs to the right and up some more stairs into the Scotland Road
Go to Barbicon in A
Speak to him and get him to talk about Georgia
Finally get the parcel and take it to Vlad going to him the same way as before the guy in the Control Room will let you through
As soon as Vlad is gone go down the Stairs to Coal Shute and retrieve the book
Incidentally you can make friends with one of the men by talking to him and insulting him till you call him quot Landlubber quot however it is not essential to this solution
Take the book to P P
Talk to her
Go to the Purser Say quot Thayer quot and offer to help him with the telegram When you've done that check the book in and inquire about the list of passengers
Find out where G Q C hangs out
This is a good time to find out where everyone else lives too
Go to the Wireless Room and you'll meet P P
who asks you to eavesdrop on Zeitel amp Co Go to A Deck and outside walk aft and listen
Georgia should also be here so talk to her again and note her request
How to send the telegram Now back to the Wireless Room
If you haven't entered it before follow the instructions I give above
To send the telegram do as follows Click on the table
Read all the telegrams if you haven't come before
The German one in code goes straight into your bag no need to do anything about it though you might like to see what it says
Note what there is in front of you
There are two instruments to the left and two to the right and another on the front
First click on the two papers in the drawer to get the instructions make a note of them
Start by clicking on the instrument on the top right hand side
Move the lever up to quot On quot this is rather difficult keep trying till the bulbs light up
Next click on the top left hand side instrument and push the lever to the left to quot Transmit quot
Then click on the instrument on the bottom right hand side and turn the knob till the line hits and the light flashes
Now you can click on the instrument on the front and simply type out the message you saw on the telegram
Go to the Purser and tell him you've sent the telegram then offer to go and tell Thayer
Instead he goes himself which gives you a chance to look at the Cargo Manifesto by the bell
Spot the name of Lemke amp Buechner
Report to P P
She sends you back to the Purser
How to get the painting Go to him and this time he is preocupied with the cufflink Mr Strauss lost
Again offer to find it We know Mr Strauss was in the Reception Room at D Deck from what other people told us so go there
You will meet Siedelmann talk to him and ask him where Strauss was sitting
At the end turn your back on the stairs and click on the left hand chair then click on the cufflink twice
You also get to talk to Zeilter in this room
Go back to the Purser and give him the cufflink Offer to take it to Strauss and he will leave pronto
Click on the key panel and take the key with the fancy keyring
Go to the Cargo Hold via A Deck and the Forecastle stairs
When you try to get in the seaman will first stop you and when he sees the keys will let you through
Advance three times and go through the door to the right
You will spot the car
Click on it to turn the lights on and look inside the box opposite Take the painting
Report to P P
yet again
She'll tell you to see the Stewart who has a message for you
Go to the Great Staircase in Deck B and talk to him
You might also meet Daisy tell her what she wanted to know and you'll get yet another message
Go to the Purser and check in the painting
Since this is important to this solution go to the Smoking Room and talk to Charles
Now go to visit Georgia in her cabin
Charles comes in and you leave
Although not strictly necessary for this solution you might as well go to see Conkling
Go to Scotland Road and keep going aft till you see him
Talk to him
Go to the Poop Deck for him
You should meet Georgia again talk to her
Go on and meet the two Hackers
Talk to them and go back to Conkling
When you've talked to him go to Scotland Road but this time go forward on your way downstairs to the rd Class Cabins you'll meet Troutt
Go along with anything he says
Go to see the girl
Well that's that done
Go to the Smoking Room and talk to Charles
You find out about the necklace
How to get the real necklace Go to Sasha's cabin
As you enter his corridor talk to the seaman you'll see
He is off to find a screwdriver
Click on the fuse panel on the wall at the back and throw over the switch marked A
Turn around and when you see Sasha leaving his cabin throw the switch again
Go to his cabin and advance Click on the Russian doll
You have to solve a puzzle here
Clockwise and top to bottom these are the numbers you need to line up


Click on the doll to get it open
Now you get the real necklace
Take it to the Purser
How to get the notebook almost Go to Deck D and find out how to get to the Squash Court
Go there
Haderlitz invites you to fence with him
Do so
I don't think it matters whether you win or lose you still get the information but I found that aiming just right off the center of his foil's guard did the trick
When he lounges left or right he usually signals it clearly
At any rate keep fencing till you've got his ring and he merely asks your for another match
After the match report to P P
and then go to the Great Staircase in A Deck
You meet the Gore Joneses with a message
Just go up the stairs and show the ring to Trask
Afterwards go to P P
and report
Go to Reception in D Deck and talk to Seidlemann
He tells you about Haderlitz's girl who is to be found in cabin D
Talk to her
Report to P P
Go to the Turkish Bath and talk to the officer asking him if you can investigate
Talk to the Stewart
Go into the Turkish Bath and from there to the Electric Bath
Click on it and pick up the scrap of paper
Take it to Trask talk to him and show him the scrap With his insight go to the Scotland Road keep going aft till you catch a glimpse of the axe and rope on the wall
Click on that and as if on cue Jack Hacker meets you and gives you another scrap of paper
Take it to Trask at his usual stand you might meet the Gore Joneses again
Don't neglect to show the scrap of paper to Trask
Go to the Parisian Cafe search the tables and you will find a packet of cigarettes take them to Trask and he tells you who they belong to
Go to the Smoking Room find Seidelmann and give him the cigarettes
He gives you some important information in return
Armed with this info go to the Boat Deck
Here you can take a little and unnecessary diversion by talking to the seaman by the bridge on the other side of the Wireless Room
He tells you Officer Morrow has lost his binoculars
Go aft and up to the first platform and find the binoculars then take them to Morrow
He will let you into the Bridge
You can try to change course but it won't do you any good
At the end talk to Morrow again
There that was nice wasn't it
You might also meet Troutt who will give you a prayer card this can be exchanged for a photo if you go to Burns at C
But since it doesn't matter why bother
And now for the real business
Find a seaman the guy in charge of the Cargo Hold by lifeboats
Talk to him and ask him if you can climb the smokestack but you will find you can only do that from the Engine Room
OK go to P P
and talk to her then go down the stairs to the Turbine Room
Just in case go down the stairs and interfere with the valves once more
Up and through to the Control Room
Once more you are asked to fix the turbine and since you know what to do you'll have no trouble
If you've forgotten ask for advice again
When you've put matters right you'll be able to go through to the Engine Room
Go left when you have the opportunity so that you can go up the smokestack
Unfortunately Vlad is there and you get into a bit of a fight
It is not important whether you win or lose but I found that alternating blows cursor to the left or right of him actually did the trick and I beat him
At the end go up the stairs all the way to the top Walk around keeping your eye on the center till you spot the diary
Get it
Guess what you've got company
Zeitel comes waving a pistol and demanding the diary stall him
There is a minor pause in your negotiations when the Titanic hits an iceberg
Never mind
Offer him the pen P P gave you
This stuns him and you are able to get down where Vlad is waiting to knock you out cold
You wake up in your cabin
What you can hear is not your head throbbing but a knock at the door
Open it and P P
will give you her next set of instructions
At this point you might like to save your game so that you can try various angles I will tell you how to complete the game quickly
Leave the cabin and turn right to go to the Great Staircase
Go up to A Deck and into the First Class Lounge
You meet with Haderlitz's girl who gives you her shawl
Go in and talk to Trask
DO NOT talk to Zeitel
Find your way out of here through the other door and go to the Smoking Room
Save a new game talk to Riviera and bet the real necklace against the boat pass
You'll probably win
You must if you don't reload and try again
Now go back to the First Class Lounge and through there to the Boat Deck Don't talk to anybody
Going aft you'll probably bump into the Gore Joneses
Ignore them
Go to the Second Class Stairs and keep going down DO NOT talk to the Hackers till you get to the Turbine Room and then go down to the contraption with the valves
You'll meet Vlad talk to him
Persuade him to exchange the notebook for the shawl
Now go all the way up to the nd Class Staircase and find P P who is around here
Talk to her and then talk to the seaman next to her
Give him the boat pass
That's it
Sit back and enjoy the finale
Smashing game wasn't it even with all the inconsistencies
For instance how did Vlad get hold of the fake necklace I was carrying in my bag In this final section you can also get frightfully involved with everyone
For instance you could talk to the Hackers and find out that Mrs Conkling has stolen the baby so they give you a letter you have to take up to her collect the baby and take it to the Hackers
You could talk to Zeitel and find out he's poisoned Georgia and he wants the map in exchange for the antidote they you rush to cabin A to save her but later Zeitel will give you the map in exchange for the boat pass
But then how will you leave the Titanic
Still it's up to you you might what to re play the last section just for fun I have a suspicion that these posibilities specially Zeitel are there to stop you from completing the game successfully but they are interesting anyway
In the main body of the game if you fail to get the book or the painting there is a whole alternative machinery in place though not getting the book will certainly stop you from winning
If you want to try that for fun you'll probably get heavily involved with the photographer at C the Gore Joneses tell you about him
When you first visit him he wants to know where is his wife
Turn right and go along to the Grand Staircase you'll see her there with her blue hat click on her
Go back to C to tell him and he will depart hurriedly leaving the door open
Go in
The Photos Now this is very tricky so save your game
First have a look around you can open the wardrobes and enjoy looking at the couple's clothing
Look at the table and click on the piece of paper to the left Read the instructions carefully
Turn the red lamp to the left to try it on
Don't touch anything else Turn right around and walk to the door turn left and click on the buttons
Turn right and make your way to the table
If it is too dark for you to see clearly press F
When you've advanced to the table click on the red lamp
Now click on the first box and get the paper
Put it in the tray numbered and count to or the image should change slightly three times
Remove the photo dragging it to tray
Count to or it should change slightly twice then click on it it will automatically be hung to dry
Because this is very tricky and you could easily spoil the photo save each time you have succeeded
When all three are done go back to the door and turn the light on
Go back to the photos and put them in the bag click on each and then on the spying glass to see close ups
Then take them to P P In other words once you've completed the game correctly try goofing up just to enjoy a different experience

Tomb Raider The Lost Valley Unorthodox Walkthroughby Noah Hinckspicassohoney yahoo com Author's comment I've done this several times after beating Tomb Raider twice the normal way when it was the only PSX game I had
It's a lot of fun and gives a pretty good rush enjoy This starts when you see the tyrannosaur coming Turn right and head into the tunnel
Kill the raptor and make your way to the far end Making sure the tyrannosaur isn't nearby drop down and jump into the small pool to the right
Surface onthe other side and kill the raptor
Now get the cog as you normally would and go back the way you came Now you should be surfaced at the small pool you just jumped into
If the tyrannosaur is lingering right there go back and to the other end of the tunnel
Either way the next part is the most difficult Start running to the temple
The tyrannosaur will probably notice you but you're just as fast
Kill the raptors while running there's no time for stopping
Run into the temple and get the second cog Now look outside and to your right you'll see a ledge you can vault onto
Do so and enter the tunnel
Thiswill lead you to the broken bridge
Jump across and get the third cog The tyrannosaur is probably right below you
Regardless you have to exit the valley so safe drop or jump and take damage if you're nervous and make a mad dash back to where you came from GAME BOOMERS hints cheats and walkthroughs

According to legend the mask is a quot greater spirit quot that bestows powers of re animation on its wearer
In this first level Lara drops from a helicopter onto an island in the Bering Sea
She finds that mercenary treasure hunters have arrived here before her

Lara questions him about what he's doing there and reveals that she's looking for the Infada artifact which she hopes lies in the ruins ahead
The blond man mentions quot voodoo magic quot but Lara is skeptical
She asks if there are others with him
He tells her that two others Randy and Rory are inside the temple apparently buried under a mudslide
He wanders off into the woods muttering something about Lara probably not leaving the ruins alive
She doesn't take much stock in his opinions and continues on her way

A cut scene follows Lara emerges from the temple and sees the psychotic blond explorer rafting down the river

He laughs and makes some dramatic gestures and the temple begins to crumble around her
Lara dodges falling stone blocks as the bad guy gets away
She starts to follow on foot then notices a quad bike nearby

He'll send the fireballs up toward the ceiling so you may need to sidestep left and right to avoid them as they fall
At close range pistols work fine and shotgun blasts are even more effective only about six or seven will do it
When he dies he'll disappear in a huge explosion leaving the Before getting it pick up a An FMV sequence follows Lara emerges from the ruins and sees a boat chugging down the river
The pilot calls out to her and she goes aboard
He apologizes for the unfortunate incident with Tony who was one of his employees and introduces himself as Doctor Willard
He's the same guy we saw earlier in Antarctica and heard over the radio at the jungle camp
He tells Lara he's inspired by the way she handled Tony and would like to offer her other work
She hesitates
Then he explains that the Infada artifact is actually one of four similar pieces fashioned from meteorite ore by Polynesians who settled an island off Antarctica
He scans the artifact and shows her an analysis of the material on his computer explaining that the ore is unique an unknown material
Lara asks how it ended up in India
He says his investigations led him to the diary of a sailor on Charles Darwin's ship the HMS Beagle
Lara begins to read and we flash back to the voyage
August
The sailor writes that he's restless and hungry
He and a few of his mates go ashore on a hunting expedition and discover four mysterious objects in a cavern of ice
We see one piece which resembles the Infada artifact but is shaped like a lizard
Before they can decide what to do with the pieces a wolf attacks killing one of the sailors
The rest barely manage to escape as the ice cavern collapses
Willard informs Lara that of the original group that found the artifacts only Stephen the diarist survived
His compatriots were killed for their pieces in India the South Pacific and Nevada and Stephen sold his artifact after returning to London
The doctor is hot to investigate the remaining three locations
Lara agrees to sign on
IMPORTANT NOTE When you finish this level you will be able to choose which area you want to go to next
Although you can play the three middle areas Nevada London and South Pacific in any order you like I strongly recommend playing them in the order given here
If you don't mind a spoiler read the beginning of the walk through for the level to find out why
Otherwise you can either trust me or take your chances

If you thought her previous adventures were exciting wait until you see what she has planned for you this time
There are massive levels spread out across exotic locations Secrets aSecret Bonus Level new moves new enemies and new vehicles to ride As always Sinjin will reveal everything you need to know to win this game and get a perfect score
All secrets are indexed at the end of this walkthrough and sorted by level making it very easy to find the one s you missed
You must find all Secrets to unlock the Bonus Level Tomb Raider is non linear and so is this solve
You can play the middle three levels in any order you wish so this Online Walkthrough is organized differently from previous solves
To navigate the various levels in this walkthrough all you have to do is pick the Location you need help with from the choices in the top window
This will open a side menu along the left which has each area within that location
Clicking on any of these menu items will take you to the text which describes that area There are a few hidden shortcuts
If you click on the Tomb Raider III logo in the top left you will instantly go to the top of the entire solve
If you click on the picture of Lara at the top you will return to the main menu in the left window TheSecret Area Indexoffers links back to the main text which describe the location of all secrets in Tomb Raider
You won't want to miss a single secret if you want to unlock theSecret Bonus Level New MovesLara adds a few new moves to her physical abilities
Now she can Sprint Crawl and Monkey Swing
Naturally there will be plenty of opportunities and puzzles which require these new abilities to complete successfully New VehiclesLara gets to drive ride five new vehicles in her third adventure
These include a boat Kayak Mine Cart Quad Bike ATV and an Underwater Propulsion Unit UPU Combat TipsCombat hasn't changed much
One of the key things to remember when fighting multiple targets is to LET OFF the fire key after you drop an enemy
This way you can acquire a new target and not waste ammo on a corpse
Lara can aim very accurately while jumping around so try to keep moving to minimize enemy damage Hardware ListStopwatchLara still has her trusty stopwatch
This allows you to check your level completion time and find out if you've missed any secrets
It also makes it impossible for me to use directions like N S E amp W in this solve FlaresYou can't do any damage with these handy items but they will be invaluable as they illuminate your surrounding area revealing traps switches and Core's new dynamic lighting engine
There are LOTS more dark areas in this adventure so make sure to keep a good reserve of flares handy and don't waste them
Remember the muzzle flash of your pistols will also light up a dark area just not as long PistolsThese are Lara's trusty sidearms she brought with her from the first game
Use them quot John Woo style quot to take out your basic baddies
They will auto aim each time you press the fire button ShotgunThis old favorite is back
Use it on groups of enemies for wide spread damage or when at close range to inflict serious damage on a single opponent Desert EagleMore powerful than the pistols this powerful handgun is Tomb Raider 's equivalent of the Magnums from the earlier games
These are great for close range combat where you need heavy firepower while you dodge Harpoon GunThe reload time on this weapon makes it good for usually a single shot
Use it to stall your enemy so you can swim to the safety of dry land
Ammo is also hard to find so conserve every harpoon you find until you absolutely need it Uzi'sAnother favorite from the first two games this weapon is very powerful and should be saved for the bigger enemies and later levels Grenade LauncherThis weapon provides some serious destruction
Grenades will explode only after they are armed and they must travel about feet before they arm
This makes this weapon a long range weapon which is good because you don't want to get caught in your own blast
Do not fire then run forward until after the explosion and resulting deaths Rocket LauncherWhat more can I say
This weapon will wreck destruction on whatever it hits
Use wisely as ammo is VERY limited MP Lara trades in her M from the last game for this new military issue Automatic Assault Rifle
This weapon is ideal for long range sniping
You cannot be running or jumping while firing this weapon Weapons and AmmunitionAmmo is scattered all over the various levels
It is always a good policy to save your bigger and better weapons for the bigger and badder enemies
Sometimes I will give you a recommendation for which weapons to use but feel free to use your weapons of choice
There will also be times when I might say quot you will find a certain weapon in a certain location quot and all you find is ammo for that weapon
This is not a bug or error in my solve but rather part of the game design
Weapons appear in certain locations but if you ALREADY have that weapon from an earlier quot pick up point quot then you will find ammo for the weapon that would otherwise be there Once again you can explore Lara's mansion before starting the REAL game
There are lots of new things to learn and do
She has expanded the gym and there is a shooting range where you even get to take shots at that pesky butler
Don't miss the Race Key that unlocks the Quad Bike so you can race around the mansion We join our adventure already in progress
Lara is currently in India searching for the legendary Infada artifact
So if we are finished with all the preliminary info let's get on with the game LARA'S HOME Learning the RopesI didn't cover any of the details of Lara's Mansion in the last solve because there just wasn't that much to do
This time however her mansion is almost a mini level in itself with lots to do and many small puzzles to solve
The house has been remodeled a bit so some areas will look different than before
Lara has also modified her indoor and outdoor assault courses to include her new abilities You start off in the bedroom and the weapons closet is unlocked this time
Open it up and grab the box of Flares then head to the main stairs
At the far corner of the landing is another door that leads to the attic same as last game
Go into the dark attic and light a flare to find a box which you can push twice
Now go back down to the library the room just off the room with the piano and TV As you enter the library turn right and find the book sticking out from the shelf
Push it to turn off the fireplace making it safe to get inside and climb up
At the top move the boxes and get more Flares
You should now see a hall
Flip the switch to open a door on a very SHORT timer The door you opened is downstairs in the hall leading to the indoor training room
You will have to use all the shortcuts and fast moves you can find to get there in time
Here is my fastest route After flipping the switch run down the hall back to the attic and down the stairs to the nd floor landing
As you exit the attic door jump over the banister and continue running down the stairs and angle right to clear the railing
Roll and start running toward the gym using the sprint to gain extra speed
Enter the door just before it closes As long as you use the sprint move only when running in a straight line you should have no trouble making it down to the basement
You should find a moveable box that you can move under the hole in the ceiling and pull up into the hall above
Follow the passage to the Aquarium
Take a swim with your fish to find and get the coveted RACETRACK KEY
This key opens the hedge maze which has since been converted into a racetrack for Lara's Quad Bike
Time to set a new record Before leaving the house you may want to visit the other secret room
Go to the swimming pool and press the button on the back of the diving platform
This opens a door back in the main foyer revealing a switch
Pulling this switch opens a door directly behind you for a very SHORT time
You will need to sprint and do the diving roll maneuver to get under the door before it shuts
Nice trophy over the fireplace Outside there are a few new things to do
The assault course has been modified to include training for Lara's new abilities
There is a target range that features Jeeves running around in a Kevlar vest combat helmet and tea tray
You can put him down but you can't kill him That's about it or at least as much as I found to do
Explore the mansion and grounds as much as you want and when you are ready to play the REAL game go to the main gate and hit the button and exit INDIA The Jungle Before you start to slide down the first hill jump over the slope to your right and slide down to the flat ledge
Jump over to the yellow rock and crouch to find Secret the Shotgun
Now start sliding down the long ramp and jump up to grab the log
Kill the monkey then jump down so you slide onto a flat section between the spikes
Now angle left and jump and slide down to the flat ledge with the Medkit
You may or may not trigger a rolling boulder trap at this point
If you hear a rumbling jump or step back to avoid the rock Jump to the area behind the tree to get the Save Gem and Secret Shells
Finish your slide to the bottom and head through the arch to the left
Collect another Save Gem then climb up the pillar just past the gem Grab the ammo on the left then return to the wall for Secret
Shell are in the opening to the left of the waterfall and some more ammo is in the third opening
Now head to the right through the arch into the large area
A small monkey is off to the left
He isn't much of a threat but kill him just the same
You should be able to find a small bush with a passage behind it that leads to a switch
Flip the switch and head back to the gate that you just opened Go through the gate and drop down to the dark hall
A switch is on your right and a deadly spike trap is on your left
Flip the switch then quickly climb into the alcove to avoid the moving wall of death
When it has passed you can go to the other end of the hall and climb up to the opening
Go through and find the cable slide and ride it down to the base of a square block
Climb onto this block then doing a short running jump into the passage and drop into the next area If you fall in the river do not fight the current
Just let it take you to a tunnel which leads to a small pool where you can exit
Watch out for Piranha A beautiful but deadly tiger will attack as you enter so warm up those pistols
Find the hollow tree and flip the switch inside to open a gate and also send a boulder rolling your way
Dodge the deadly rock then follow its path of origin to another switch which opens a gate around the corner
Head into this next room and kill the attacking tiger
Head to the right through some thick plants and find the Shells on a small ledge to the left Continue into the next area where another tiger will offer itself for target practice
Keep going until you see some mist rising out of a dark patch in the middle of the room
This is a deadly spiked pit so stay away from it
Circle around to the right and claim the ammo in the trees then crawl under the fallen tree and kill another tiger before collecting the Save Gem Standing at the end of the tree you should be able to jump and grab and climb into the tree
This area is Secret but the real trick is getting back out alive
Hang and drop into a spiked pit with slopes that you can jump back and forth
Keep moving to one side and you will soon escape the spikes
Grab the ammo near the rocks then drop into the tunnel and walk through the spikes
Pull yourself out of this area and return to the end of the tree where you started all this Follow the hallway to a spiked ledge and kill the monkey before walking through the spikes
Do a running jump and grab to the outside corner of the hall then jump to the slope above the hall and slide down
Grab the edge as you fall and shimmy to the right until you can pull up and get the Save Gem Climb up and shimmy over to the dark passage and use a flare to spot and kill the monkey and locate the switch at the other end which opens a gate down below
It also triggers a boulder trap so do a roll and run back out of the passage
When the threat is over go back inside and find the hidden ledge above the switch
Jump and climb up to find Secret ammo then do a safety drop off the ledge to the area below Back down in the jungle you should spot a monkey who will lead you into a boulder trap
As you run across this area several boulders will start to roll down at you
After the third and final boulder has come to a stop you can head up the slope toward the bushes
Keep to the right as you climb the hill and you should soon discover a hole behind the bushes
Grab the Medkit then drop into the pit quickly grabbing the next ledge to avoid the spikes below
Pull up and enter the passage to find Secret some Flares and a Save Gem Turn and jump across to the next ledge then reverse and do another jump and grab to climb out of the pit
Return to the area with the three boulders and go past them until you reach a river
Dive in and swim to the right to find some ammo on the shore
Jump to the small island then jump and pull up to the ledge above where you will find a switch to pull that opens a door off in the distance Do a running jump and grab from the island to the ledge just next to the pillar then ride the cable slide to the bottom and take the hall to the left
A Save Gem is accessible from the top of the pillar and you can also kill a pair of tigers from the safety of this high perch Your next objective is getting inside that opening to the right of the waterfall
To do this you must flood this chamber so head to the left into the dark passage
Cross the pool and get some valuable Flares from the middle ledge before heading right until you reach a dead end
Pull the block until the nearby gate opens then enter and flip the switch there to open another gate in the floor behind the stone you just pulled
Jump in and return to the previous room and climb out onto the narrow bridge where you can flip the switches at either end to open yet another gate in the other room Head back to that room and enter this gate to find an flip another switch which floods an upcoming room
One more swim takes you back to the previous room where you can go through the door between the torches and into the room you just flooded only moments ago
Swim over to the far waterfall and get out of the water
Find the passage behind the falls and follow it to the ladder and climb up
Walk through the waterfall and climb up the other waterfall before doing a running jump back to the previous waterfall
You should find a switch at the top of the falls that opens an underwater gate Jump or dive into the water below and look for some green stone steps
Exit and climb onto the high ledge then do a running leap to the next ledge where you can claim a Save Gem
Jump back into the water and go through that gate you just opened
After a short swim you will reach the next room which has ammo and Shells all being guarded by a tiger
When you have taken the objects and killed the striped menace climb that ladder Go around the corner and kill the monkey who just ran off with the Indra Key
Get the key then look down and spot the tiger lurking below
Kill him from your safe location then drop down
Make sure to avoid the pulsating brown quicksand as you make your way to the ledge where you can use the Indra Key to open the gate
More ammo is in a small niche to the left of the door
Enter the gate and exit the level INDIA Temple RuinsHead up the path past the tree and kill the snakes
If you get bit by a snake you MUST use a medkit otherwise the poison will slowly drain your health until you die
You may want to wait until all snakes in an area are dead before healing yourself otherwise you could waste valuable medkits if you keep getting bit A switch over by one of the snakes opens a gate in the floor nearby
Drop through the gate and light a flare so you can explore this passage
Get the Medkit and kill the snake that guards it before exiting the passage
This next area has some water infested with deadly piranha and you might find some things of interest over by the stairs It may sound crazy but dive into the water and swim QUICKLY to the ledge which is covered by a few inches of water
Get out of the water while you still have some meat on your bones and head up the path and flip the switch to open an underwater gate between a pair of submerged ledges
Dive back into the water and swim through the gate
Exit on the other side with piranha nipping at your boots A huge mound of dirt lies ahead
As you approach you should be able to just make out a flat ledge in the pile which is within jumping distance
Make this jump then walk around to the ledge on the left then jump over to the stone ledge
Walk around this ledge until you reach an opening by the second waterfall
Enter and collect the Save Gem then do a running leap out onto the tree Explore the branches for ammo and Flares then head back to the main branch and do another running jump to the left to grab and pull up onto the ledge
Another running leap takes you to the waterfall where you can make your way up to the second waterfall
Here you can drop and shimmy to the right to find some Shells hidden in a niche
Keep crawling until you are able to stand then do a safety drop to the next area Over to the left is a ledge you need to jump grab and pull up onto
Now crawl into the cave and watch out for a pair of snakes who block your exit down the ramp
The next area has an impressive statue and a stone block to the right that you can pull out
Some Shells are behind it so get them then enter the opening behind the block
As you exit another statue comes to life so run to safety
The mound of dirt takes you to a stone ledge with a Save Gem on it
Keep circling the room and use your Shotgun to take out this giant menace After the battle is over look for a hole in the floor and drop in where you will find a switch that opens a gate
Finally move the block by the switch and enter the next area
The air is alive with poison darts but this is Tomb Raider and Lara can CRAWL in this game
Quickly drop into the nearby hole to get Secret another Medkit then get out fast before the rolling boulder crushes you Keep crawling past the flying darts and collect the Shells Medkit and Flares before returning to the statue room
Enter the gate then carefully make your way across the sludge
Always keep moving so you don't sink
Head up the slope on the other side then do a running leap to grab the next ledge
Go down the passage to find and flip a switch which opens the nearby gate Enter into the next room and quickly jump the swinging blade then sprint to avoid the spikes moving in for the kill
Up the stairs you will find a cage with a switch next to it that opens a gate above
DON'T FLIP THE SWITCH YET
First pull out the block from the wall then push it over to the left then climb onto it and jump grab and pull up onto the ledge
Around the corner is a ladder
Jump and climb up the ladder to find Secret a room full of assorted items
Flip the switch then climb back down to the main floor Now you can flip that switch by the cage then push the block over so you can climb onto it and jump over to the ledge
Go through the gate and dive into the water
Pull the lever to open the next gate and swim through
Above you is a closed gate so keep swimming until you reach a pair of levers
Pull both of them to open the gate in the ceiling the swim up to get some much needed air Jump into the pool and pull the pair of levers that are opposite each other to activate the statues that will breath fire
The remaining lever opens a timed door where you can claim several items also known as Secret if you look closely you will notice hidden platforms that are floating above
The fire should make them visible enough to jump and grab onto the first then over to the next and finally to the ledge where you can flip the switch
Drop down and get the Save Gem before running through the door on the left
The gate is on a timer so be fast or you will have to repeat the last part This long hall has cages at each end and the one right next to you has spikes
Flip the nearby switch to open the cage at the far end of the hall and start the cage next to you moving towards you
Sprint down the hall past the open cage and grab the Key of Ganesha
Go through the gate and wait for the spikes to go past
When it is safe return to the hall and get the ammo and Medkit by the switch Head back to the previous room with the pool which is now replaced with sludge
Climb the sludge and enter the passage on the right
You should find some Flares nearby which you really will be needing
Climb the stairs then retreat when the boulder comes rolling at you and duck into the alcove to the left
Start back up the stairs until you reach a pair of gates and a hole in the floor
The path branches right and left at this point
We will explore both but since the left has an immediate trap we'll explore the right first Going right trips the boulder trap on the left passage so flip the switch and enter the gate
Ignore the temptation of exploring that hole in the wall unless you have saved recently and want to see a cool death
Head up the passage until you reach a large room with statues a Save Gem and floor grates
Continue down the hall and kill that pesky monkey who is running off with your Medkit
Finally drop off and hang then climb down the wall to the floor below You should now find yourself back in the room with the dead statue from earlier in the level
Head up the mound and over to the ledge where you should find a pair of switches which will open a gate below
Return to the floor and go through the gate into the next room
Go past the pit and into the next door where you will need to swim across to flip the switch
Avoid the deadly fire of the statues and if you get torched just jump into the water to put out the flames
When you finally flip the switch you will open a gate underwater which you can swim through while making sure to avoid the poison darts which shoot from the far wall Grab the Medkit from the shore then head to the other grassy ledge where you will find a ladder that leads up to a ledge behind you
When you get above the ledge do a backward flip onto it
Then do a running leap to the next ledge in front of you
Jump to the next ledge then turn and climb the wall
Turn again and jump onto the next ledge then turn to see a ledge with a snake ready to strike
Kill the snake from your current position then jump over to his ledge
Another jump will put you in a room with a rolling boulder
Dodge it by heading up the left past the poison dart traps
Crawl under the darts and other assorted traps and get the Medkit on the left before doing a running leap and grab to claim the Save Gem in the alcove Return to the pit and jump down onto any of the corners
Walk through the blades and then crouch and crawl through the tunnel to reach a small room with Secret some ammo guarded by a snake
Drop to the water below and make your way back to the area where you got the last Save Gem
A moveable block in the corner can be pushed to reveal a second block which can be pushed several times
You should soon discover a hidden switch that will flood the pit with water
Keep going into the next room A pair of boulders will start rolling towards you as you enter
Sprint out of harms way and head off to the left where you will have to jump across a pit full of spikes
Look down into the hole and note the spikes on one side and water on the other
Naturally you will want to drop into the water and swim into the next room with more statues breathing fire at you
You should now be at the pit you just flooded so dive in and flip the switch to open the gate
Swim down the passage to get the second Key of Ganesha then return to the surface and exit this area The next room has a pair of locked gates with a pair of keyhole and you happen to have a pair of keys
Enter the now open gates and note the spiked ceiling dropping towards you
Run to the wall and climb up the ladder where you will find your next Save Gem
The block over in the right corner is moveable and needs to be pulled out so you can climb on and do a running jump to the ledge and the switch above
Turn and do a running leap to the next ledge to find and flip a second switch which opens the gates
It also causes a pair of boulders to come rolling into the room which you can easily avoid by jumping to either side Through the gates is a room with two paths each guarded by flaming statues
You can dodge the flames with careful timing and use of the sprint run
Wait for the flames to start to die out then sprint towards them and turn at the last minute before they flare up again
You should now be in the next room with another statue who comes to life as you enter
Kill this one just like the last and when he is dead take his sword Climb onto the ledge with a multi armed statue and the second statue will come to life below
Kill him and take his sword then return to the other statue and put the pair of swords in his empty hands
This opens the exit from this room
Enter the next room and take your pick of holes to crawl through
In the next room drop to the floor and go through this room to the next where another statue will come to life as your approach the center platform When he is dead you can get the Key of Ganesha from the middle of the room then head over to the gate which will open for you
Light up the place with a flare and sprint into the room and flip the switch at the other end
The spiked ceiling will start to descend so quickly flip the second switch to open the floor grate and drop in
Below is the second Key of Ganesha and a gate which will open as soon as you take the key
You can now return to the room where you got the first key Head into the next room with the Save Gem floating in the air and the pit filled with water
A very strong current will try to pull you into some spikes on either side of this room so quickly swim to the left or right and flip the switch next to the spikes
Swim back to the front of this room then over to the other switch and flip it to deactivate the strong currents in this area
You can now pick up the third Key of Ganesha before swim up and climb out of the pit Now you can head over to the wall with the three locks and use your hard earned keys to open the gate at the top of the stairs
Climb the stairs and go through the gate to end this challenging level INDIA Ganges RiverThat Quad Bike tempts you right away as you begin this new level but don't get on it quite yet
Go up to the ramp and drop off the side and hang then climb down the ladders which take you to the left
Next is a difficult series of running jumps
Watch your timing as you make the jump as well as your headroom throughout the arc of the leap
Backflip from the low area after the small gap then do one more running jump to access Secret Once you are in the secret room face the first slope and jump to it then jump more time and grab the edge to reach the flat area and some Shells
Now you get to make your way all the way back to the Quad Bike
Get up to full speed and make the jump over the ramp and keep going along the wall and give the ATV extra gas when you get near a drop off When you reach a small pit you should be able to find a ladder nearby
It leads down to Secret
Get back on your ATV and circle around to the ledge to make a big jump
Back up against the wall for extra speed and to make sure you are lined up squarely for the jump
After the jump you will arrive at a gold door and will be forced to leave your bike behind for now Take a look at the wall near the ramp you just jumped then run and jump into the passage
Crawl along the passage until you can stand then kill the two snakes hiding in the shadows as you continue through the passage
You should come to a hole which you can jump across before arriving at a switch guarded by some monkeys
Flip the switch to open the gold door then make your way back to the ATV
Drive until you reach the Save Gem At this point you need to stay on the main path
You could take the path to the right which is a major shortcut to the end of the level but in doing so you would miss several secrets and ruin any chance of playing the Secret Bonus Level
If you insist on taking the shortcut here is a quick narrative of what to expect SHORTCUT Take the ATV down a bumpy slope and jump over the river
You'll end up in a tunnel where a monkey will soon arrive with a Medkit
Kill the monkey and any of his friends then continue down the passage until you reach a green cliff with two openings
Explore both areas and watch out for the snake who is waiting to attack The upper entrance leads to a small room that you can crawl to and get the first Gate Key
Follow the crawlspace along the green passage that leads to hallway with more monkeys and the Gate Key Locks
You need to jump and grab the ledge at the end of the hall to get outside where you can spot the gate and some deadly quicksand nearby
Take the Save Gem then find the steep slope and do a backflip onto it
Grab on as you start to slide Jump off the slope to reach the pillar which you can grab onto and pull up
Jump over to the branches and into the opening in the wall where you will find branches and a ledge
Kill any monkeys that get in your way then jump a few times to the left to get some ammo from another ledge
Over to the right is a building with the second Gate Key and more monkeys
Keep an eye on that flaming statue as you head downstairs then flip the switch to open the gate outside
More monkeys will arrive on the scene but they shouldn't be too much of a problem Return to the hall with the ledge and the Gate Key Locks and open the gate
Return to the ATV and ride it up and make a daring jump over the quicksand
Go around the building where you obtained the second key and head into the jungle by the river
You will make one final jump across the river to get back on the main path a little bit faster but lacking several secrets Head along the right side of the slope and make a huge jump
Force your ATV into the wall to slow it down after you land or you will probably have a fatal accident
Continue up the slope and then turn right
You should now be in a large room with a large hole in the floor
Head around the hole and up the ramp outside
Stay to the right and stop when you reach the top and exit your bike
Walk out onto the ramp and you should be able to spot the next secret You should be able to find some ammo on the ledge then jump and pull up to the crawlspace for Secret Harpoons and a Save Gem
Return to your bike and follow the ramp until you reach the hall that splits off in two directions
Both passage lead to the same open area with a Save Gem high above and another ramp to jump your ATV across
You will have to follow the ramp up as it twists around several sharp corners until you reach the actual jump
Naturally there is a big hole in the middle of the ramp but you should be able to get over it with lots of speed Ditch the bike and get the Save Gem then get ready to go for the next secret
Climb down the nearby ladder and from the top of the cliff you should see the Secret along the ledge on the left
Follow the top ledge and do a running leap across the chasm to the next ledge
You may need to take care of a vulture about now
Do a running jump to the next slope followed by another jump and a grab so you can pull yourself up and crawl in to claim Secret
To exit simply jump back to the slope and jump once more to get back across From the ledge above the falls you should be able to see a small ledge below and to the right
Jump down to the ledge and quickly turn to kill the three vultures who attack
Some ammo is on the ledge and you should also spot a crack which leads to Secret
Do a running leap and a grab to cling to the ledge and shimmy right
Continue to the water and walk through the falls and climb the rocks to exit this level INDIA Caves of KaliyaThis level is basically just a big maze so I will try to be specific with my directions
There are lots more passages available to explore than I am mentioning in this solve
I am only outlining the areas useful in completing this level At the first intersection head left to get the Flares
The next intersection has a crawlspace to the left and a pair of dead ends to the right
A hall continues on to the left of the crawlspace so follow it around until you reach a hole in the floor
Drop into the hole to get some more Flares then climb out and return to the beginning of the level and take the right path After a short crawl you will be running down a ramp being chased by a boulder
You will probably have to sprint to keep ahead of the boulder but be ready to make a sharp turn at the bottom of the ramp to get out of the rock's way
Now head off to the left and explore the passage
You will notice a small alcove to the right which you are about to use
You may want to light this area with a flare before you proceed
Continue down the hall and when you hear the boulder coming at you roll and run back to the alcove to avoid the boulder Now continue down the hall and jump and grab onto the ledge and crawl into the next series of passages
Watch out for snakes as you explore the area around the left corner
Return to the crawlspace and continue down the right passage as it winds around to the left ending in a dead end with some Shells
Return to the way intersection and take the path opposite the crawlspace or turn right
Follow the hall until you notice a raised section of floor
Looking left you should notice a block that you can push out past the raised floor revealing a passage to the right
Continue down that hall and turn right at the next intersection
Make a left at the next intersection and finally another right and you should work your way around to a dead end with a hole in the floor Drop into the hole and follow this new hall that leads to another crawlspace
Go through to arrive at another intersection
Head down the hall until you reach a room with Flares a hole and a Save Gem
Jump over the hole to get the gem then do a safety drop into the hole YIKES
Surrounded by no less than four snakes
You will be safe as long as you are standing on the plant in the center of the room
More snakes are waiting by the pair of ramps at the other end of the room and a rolling boulder adds to the excitement
It's best to dodge the boulder then kill the snakes
If you try to do both at once you will certainly get bit
When you have killed the remaining six snakes follow the hall where the boulder rolled into and get the Medkit and the Save Gem Slide down the ramp and meet the BOSS
Head to the left of the landing and get ready to do lots of jumping and firing
Keep your back against the wall and always keep moving and jumping to avoid his homing missiles
When he is dead you can collect the Grenade Launcher and grenades from the ledges
Don't bother getting these first
I learned the hard way that this guy is immune to grenades
Finally move to the center platform and take the Infada Artifact to end your adventures in India LONDON Thames WharfAs you begin your adventures in London check out the slope wall to the right where you will find the first secret
Do a running jump over the wall and get the ammo and Save Gem before using the box to get over the wall

Avoid the barbwire and make your way down the sloped roof
Finally walk through the remaining barbwire and kill the rats and claim Secret Return to the crane then make your way back to the beginning of the level
Now hang from the walkway until you can spot a ramp and a switch below you
Drop onto the slope then jump and grab the ledge and pull up to flip the switch
Do a running jump and grab to the next ledge and get the Medkit then slide down to the green door that opened when you flipped that last switch The second part of the platform in this dark area will collapse as you walk onto it so do a sprint roll to get across it and onto the next stable section

Go around the corner and open the door on the right then sprint back to the kitchen and head right then left into the hall
Run all the way back to where the prisoners are so they can take care of the guard chasing you
When all is safe return to the door where the guard came from and explore that room You should find a switch that opens the vent above the grill
Jump to the crack so you can shimmy left and jump from the slope to the ledge across the pit
Pull up into the crawlspace
Follow the corridor until you spot an inmate in the hall
Continue on to the green passage and let the guard go by
When he moves to the left you can sprint to the right and get out of sight before he turns
Head right and dodge the next guard as you cross the open area and make your way to the lower prison area Open the cell to free another prisoner and he will take off down the hall
Follow him as he proceeds to beat on a guard allowing you to get a Security Pass which opens the nearby door
Continue down the large passage and when the guard spots you lead him on a chase down the left hall
Open the cell in the passage and get the key after the beating is over
This key is a perfect match for the lock back in the open area When you come across the guard below you need to duck and enter the crawlspace and head toward the switch
Wait for the guard to go left then flip the switch and jump over the red laser to get into the hall before the guard shoots you
Continue down this hall to the next room
From the walkway do a safety drop from the lowest support beam to the ground
Go climb the ladder to enter the corridor with the guard on duty
He is guarding the level's final secret so you will have to return when you have some weapons Sneak past the guard and return to the red passage and use the Security Pass in the lock and climb up the ladder
Push the button to open the small door
There is also a switch nearby that will close this door
Under NO circumstance should you press this switch otherwise you will never get that final secret
Instead just dive in the water and get the Save Gem Swim through the long passage until you can climb out and jump the lasers to reach the ledge
You should now be in the cargo area where you can climb some boxes to the left to find your Pistols and Desert Eagle in a small room
Watch out for a very deadly gun turret as you leave this room
Hang a right and sprint to safety until the gun shuts down
Then you can climb up the boxes and make your way to the final secret Head through that door you hopefully left open and make your way to the main floor by the big dish
Then go to the hall with the guard you sneaked by earlier and finish him off
Take his Security Pass and open the door at the end of the hall
The short passage beyond is home to Secret a Grenade Launcher Return to the cargo room and this time go up the slope and take out the guards with your favorite weapon
When the passage is clear climb the ladder to find a button to the right
Pushing the left button will bring in more guards which probably isn't a good thing since you are trying to save ammo
Climb onto the box so you can reach the upper ledge in the cargo area then monkey swing across to the next ledge
Kill the next guard and take his Security Pass to open the locked gate
Kill the small army of guards and finally climb into the truck to leave this level and head for Area NEVADA Area The key to this level is to kill your enemy fast
They will usually not attack you but rather make a dash for the nearest alarm switch to call in for reinforcements
Use your Desert Eagle and you should be able to kill these guys quickly and accurately from a distance When you arrive get out of the truck and get the items from the nearby crates
Chase down the guard and kill him before he hits the alarm switch
Get the MP and use the button not the alarm switch to open the grate which lets you crawl in to get a Medkit The next area has laser traps get used to them as they are everywhere
Enter the crawlspace and crawl to the left to get another Medkit
Go back to the tunnel as the lasers move away
Wait until they move above you then run to the ledge and grab and pull up get out of the path of the returning lasers
When the guard moves off to the right crawl out of the passage and quickly kill the guard before he hits the alarm You will soon arrive at a laser trigger turret which can easily be avoided by simply crawling through the hole in the wall
Continue along the passage and kill another guard and continue until you find the switch above the trapdoor
Flip the switch and fall below turning left and heading to the right of the pillar when you land
A guard is already running for an alarm to your left
Kill him fast or lose access to the first secret Gather up the Grenades then drop to the mesh floor and flip the switch to open the trapdoor which drops you down once again
Kill the next guard and go through the open gate leading to the crawlspace which is also considered Secret
Collect the ammo and drop through the trapdoor to the hall below
Another guard needs your swift attention before you move off to explore around the corner Flip the switch to open a cell releasing a prisoner
He will move off to fight a guard while you can duck inside to get the Medkit
Back in the long passage you will need to use the crawlspace to avoid the numerous laser traps and get another Medkit and Shotgun in the process
Kill the guard next to the buttons which monitor the upcoming trap As you approach the door guards will move in from both sides
When they are dead you can find a switch in one of their hiding places that opens the crawlspace in the other
Continue up the corridor and trip the green laser to activate the alarm and kill the guard who arrives on the scene
When you have to choose your next path head to the right and use the wall for protection from the sniper over by the missile
Once he is dead get the Code Clearance Disk and head back down the hall and take the left passage Jump over the lasers to reach the console and use the disk to get that missile out of the way
Now you can get the ammo from the ledge and prepare to get the next secret Do a running jump to the ladder between the missiles and climb up
Backflip from the top and kill the sniper lurking in the corner
Jump over to his location through the gap in the beams and get the Hangar Access Key
At the other end of his ledge is a platform you can drop onto
A weird grating on the wall can be blasted and you can crawl into the tunnel to claim Secret a much needed Save Gem
Return to the missile bay and find the passage on the ground floor Avoid the hole in the floor that leads to the launch control area
Use the Hangar Key when you find the lock and enter
Kill the guard on the train platform before dropping down near the deadly electric rail
Climb up the mesh and push the button to call the train
Jump from the ledge to the train then jump to the hall above to monkey swing over the gratings that open up as you pass by
Keep an eye on the lasers and wait for them to move away before dropping down just as they reverse and come back at you Another guard is running off for help
Kill him before he gets it then continue up the hall into the next area
Go around the UFO and watch out for those green electic eyes that will activate those deadly gun turrets
When you reach the boxes climb up to the opposite passage and kill the guard up ahead
He is headed for an alarm down the hall to the left and you better not let him reach it The room with the pair of buttons is tricky and dangerous
A guard will arrive when you press the buttons the first time
When they are dead you can finish the puzzle in comfort
Push the left button then quickly press the button on the right by jumping right and rolling then use the white top of the console to get to the other walkway and drop to the floor and run out the door Kill the next guard and study all those switches
Flip the two switches on the right then the second switch from the left to access the UFO
Return to the UFO and push the button before climbing the ladder
Backflip from the ladder to the rafters then do a running jump across the rafters until you reach the catwalk above the UFO
Get the Launch Code and return to that hole in the floor I mentioned earlier that leads to Launch Control Use the code to access the button and as soon as you push it jump to the left and roll and keep running
Use the sprint for extra speed to escape the fireball
Return back to the area where the missile used to be and kill the guard who arrived to check out all the noise
Open the passage and enter as the door seals behind you gulp
Continue past the laser trap and kill the sniper and anybody else who gets in your way
Get the key to the UFO and finally flip the switch below to open the trapdoor Return to the area with the UFO and gather up the items lying about before climbing back into the rafters
Head past the walkway leading to the UFO and do a running jump and grab to the open door leading to the aquarium
Inside is Secret another Save Gem Finally the moment you've been waiting for use the UFO Key to get inside the ship where more guards are waiting to give you a hard time
There's no going back as the door seals shut behind you
When everyone is dead except for you hopefully get the relic from the upper area and you can leave Nevada SOUTH PACIFIC ISLANDS Coastal VillageThis level features two unique paths to get to the village and each path shares a common pair of secrets while having it's own unique third secret
If you know the secret path you can also claim the third unique secret from the other path and actually get four out of a possible three secrets for this level
I'll tell you how to do it if you want to make the trip
You will get no extra prizes or bonuses only the admiration of Lara and myself for being so diligent On a final note you don't get to find or fire that cool gun in the following picture
I just included it because it looked cool and it was in a jungle setting
Sorry if you got all excited Begin the level by heading right and swim into the lagoon
Below is a block and a Smuggler's Key crucial for finding that forth secret
Swim out onto the beach and get the Medkit then investigate those cliffs
Do a running jump over to the slope and grab on to shimmy right until you can get up on the flat surface
Jump over the next flat area then do a running leap to grab and pull up onto the ledge with Secret MP ammo Now the paths diverge
One route leads down behind the yellow colored slope
The other starts inside the hut where you can use the Smugglers Key to open the trapdoor
This route is the ONLY way to get all four secrets on the island
Since the trapdoor route requires some backtracking along the OTHER route I will explain it first
If you choose the trapdoor route I will tell you when it's time to backtrack Slide down the slope behind the yellow ridge
You cannot get back up this slope so the trapdoor and forth secret is forever out of reach unless you restore
Head into the thick bushes where a native is hiding
Do a running jump and grab to the ledge above the swamp
You will trigger a dart trap but as long as you don't move they won't hit you
Run and jump out of here when the darts have past You will pass under a rope bridge and continue to the opening where more natives await
Climb up the roots of the large tree then pull up onto the ledge
Some Shells are a few ledges and jumps away in the opposite direction of the swamp
Find and follow the branch that runs along the rope bridge
Do a running jump to grab the branch and take it to the other side where you can find Serpent Stone
A concealed ledge is above you and has Secret ammo on it
Slide down to the ground and head over to the waterfall Drop down and get the Save Gem then follow the path until you can jump behind the waterfall into a dark area
You should find Serpent Stone in this room
Now return to the exit and jump to the slope and walk down it so you don't fall off
Make your way to the platform in the middle of the falls and climb the ladder
Follow the passage and keep climbing to reach the upper level
Kill the native waiting on the ledge then do a running leap and grab to the next ledge gt From this ledge you should be able to jump to the next ledge near the final stone
Jump around the corner next to the torch and get Serpent Stone
You now can just slide down from the ledge and find the passage with the slots for the three stones
Put each stone in its resting place and the entrance to the village will open Enter the village and kill the native on the ledge above
More natives move in from the left
You should get a Medkit and a Rocket is in one of the huts
Another native over to the left is shooting poison darts
Dodge them and kill him quickly
Follow the path to the left and kill another native on the ledge before turning the wheel which opens the path back to the right
Return to the village and kill more attacking natives who try to stop you
Head into the new open area along the right path Natives are waiting between the huts to surprise you
There are also some Shells on the ledge nearby
Between the huts is a dark path
If you light a flare you should spot a secret cave
Keep an eye out for attacking natives as you get Secret from inside the cave Now head to the treehouse and climb the ledge to search the huts above
Watch out for more native snipers with dart shooters Remember that poison will slowly eat away at your health even after the initial hit Turn the wheel in the hut to open a door below the treehouse
This will also summon a native who needs to learn about the proper use of gun powder Jump out of the window in the treehouse and over to the sloped roof
Jump again as soon as you land then grab to cling to the ledge
Climb into the passage and kill the guy in there before proceeding down the hall
Watch out for the hole in the floor as you make your way to the top of the hut where you can reach the vines above
Grab them and monkey swing to the other end then turn to the right and head to the intersection and keep left In the next hut you will find a button which raises a grating allowing you to get by the deadly fire
This trap is quite deadly so do it fast and do it right
After you push the first button turn and kill the native then sprint past the spinning blades and turn the wheel
Now slide backwards and hang before dropping to the slope below A giant crocodile is lurking about the water in this area so you may want to get to the safety of shore quickly so you have the advantage
Follow the tunnel to the end of this level ALTERNATE ROUTE Go through the trapdoor in the hut and the run and jump from the upper section to dodge the trap
Climb up to the torch in the next cave and kill the native shooting darts at you
Do a monkey swing from the nearby ledge until you can drop down and climb to the green rocks to the right
Climb up to the corner above the entrance then monkey swing over towards the gem
Watch out for the crocs in the water below Jump onto the slope and slide down then jump the gap at the bottom to reach the opposite ledge
Another sniper is lurking in the tall grass above
Do a running jump and grab the ladder and climb up to the Medkit
Hang onto the ledge and shimmy left to get the Save Gem before running off this ledge toward the big wall You should now be on the rope bridge the one that would be above you if you took the other route
Continue to the large room but stay out of the light
Find and flip the switch to turn off the dart trap and allow access to the chute leading to the village
Claim Secret If you don't plan on backtracking and choose instead to take the chute to the village then the last secret will be and the secret in the village with be Now that you have the extra secret from the Smuggler's Key Route you can now decide if you want to take the chute directly to the village or return to the bridge and collect the Serpent Stones and finish the level the original way
If you choose the chute you will end up in the village and canproceed from there If you choose to get the Serpent Stones and all secrets in this level then return to the rope bridge and jump out to the pillar on the right then over to the ledge with Serpent Stone and pull up onto the concealed ledge with the ammo and the next secret Continue your adventure from this point SOUTH PACIFIC ISLANDS Crash SiteYou will need to use the map to get across the swamp alive
Make sure to do running jumps to clear all the danger zones
Just before you make the final jump out of the swamp turn left and jump and pull up into the small area to get Secret
Do a running jump from the lower corner to get back to the previous area where you can make that final running jump out of the swamp
Make sure to grab or you will come up short The fog up ahead hides some rocks and a deadly raptor
Kill the raptor before climbing the rocks to the next area where another raptor attacks from the left
When he is dead take the right path until you reach the large tree
A dark passage is behind the tree and leads to more raptors and quite a few items
Flip the pair of switches to open the door and exit The next open area is infested with more raptors
Take the passage to the right of the waterfall and follow it around to the right
Climb the ladder and backflip to the slope then jump to the branch and whip out those guns and shoot the raptor which falls into the water below a tasty treat for the piranha Jump up and grab the high branch and carefully walk out onto the limb to get Secret
Now you can jump into the water below and flip the switch
Don't worry about the piranha they are still eating that raptor you fed them earlier Raptors are everywhere in the next passage
Kill them all as you make your way to the dark room with the box and many switches in it
Each time you flip the switch raptors will rush into the room
Climb the box to kill them or chase them off from safety before flipping the next switch
After you have flipped all three switches jump from the box to the upper ledge where you can get Lt Tuckerman's Key and kill more raptors waiting to ambush you Take the path back near the plane crash
Any raptors you didn't kill earlier will now be attacking
Use grenades to kill multiple raptors if you can get them bunched up in the hall
Find the small corridor by the plane and follow it to a lookout over an open area
Some ammo is nearby so get it then head toward the soldier
Soldiers are friendly UNLESS you fire on them first so don't make any more enemies than you already have As you near the soldier a pair of raptors attack so make your way back to the ledge
Both the raptors and the soldier will assist you in the upcoming battle with the T Rex if you let them live
Plan your strategy then drop down and head for the T Rex nest
Taking Commander Bishop's Key from the nest will trigger the arrival of momma T Rex You can try to fight this monster if you want or let the raptors and the soldier distract her while you get those doors open
Either way sprint towards the torch at the other end of this area and flip the switch to get you access to the second switch
Run over and flip that switch to open the exit which lets you leave and also lets any surviving raptors from the first part of this level IN
This isn't a bad thing since they will more than likely attack the T Rex instead of you
Even if you killed everything prior to this area one more raptor will join the fight Before leaving this battle zone find the branch and jump and grab onto it from the ledge below
Pull up and get Secret Medkit then jump over to the tree and jump to the landing to get some Flares before heading all the way back to the plane wreck Locate the pillar in the dark area and jump and grab to the top of it where you can then climb up the tree and monkey swing over to the trunk
Keep on swinging out onto the long limb and drop off when the camera moves out for the big picture
Climb down the wall and shimmy to the left and pull up into the crawlspace Now climb down the rock face into the small alcove then monkey swing to the door that overlooks the large room
A ledge below has a switch you need to flip to access the second switch
Climb around and drop and grab and climb some more until you can pull up onto the ledge with the second switch
Flip it then return to the first switch and flip that one again to access the third and final switch Now you need to monkey swing over to the wall near the dead end
Turn around and climb down the wall to the bottom so Lara is hanging only by her hands
Then climb up her feet get on the ladder then backflip to the hidden ledge where the third switch is
Flip the switch then jump back to the ladder and climb up to the ledge on the right
Do a running jump to the slope near the middle of the large room and grab the edge as you slide and shimmy right until you can backflip to the central column
Then jump up to the monkey swing and exit into the new area with the plane Do a running jump to grab onto the limb then another running leap will put you on the plane
Go inside and kill the raptor and use the keys in the cockpit to turn on the power
Now head further down into the plane and flip the switch to extend the big gun and fire on the raptors who are doing battle with soldiers outside the plane
The gun will also blast holes into the walls in the building across the river
When everything is safe you can exit this level through the hole in the wall SOUTH PACIFIC ISLANDS Madubu GorgeGet ready to quot shoot the rapids quot in this exciting and dangerous level
Paddling the Kayak isn't too difficult once you figure out the moves
Make sure to practice in the calm water before hitting the rapids
Also remember that your back paddle is much more effective than any other move while in the boat
It will slow you down and help your turn sharper First check out the starting location and clean up the resident bats and the dragon living in the tree
Another dragon is under the ledge in the gorge so don't let him surprise you
Climb down the pillars then jump over to the large block in the center
You can now jump over to the rocks and grab on
Shimmy over to the right and flip the switch to open a door back at the beginning of this level
You can now shimmy to the left and continue or if you want to get some extra ammo do a daring backflip from the slope back to the block in the middle of the river and return to the start If you returned to the start then look under the overhang and get the ammo
Ignore the Kayak or you will miss out on the level's first pair of secrets
Return to the middle rock and jump back to the cliff and shimmy left
Hang and drop and grab on to the lower ledge
The monkey swing above will take you to the other side of the gorge but you need to be following the trail along the shore
Jump over the sloped area and land on the flat ledge near the opening in the rocks Head past the sealed door and do a safety drop to the ledge
Jump and do a backflip over the razor grass and crawl into the dark crawlspace
A dragon attacks with his poison breath as you continue to claim the Save Gem from the end of the passage
Watch for another spitting dragon on your way out Head to the stair and take care of any resistance you encounter
Push the button to open that sealed door then go check out the passage beyond the door to find a waterfall to the left
Behind the falls you will find some ammo and trigger Secret
A monkey swing provides access to the ledge above the slope Slide down the slope then jump and grab the pillar
Then run and jump to the middle pillar and get the Save Gem before continuing in that same direction
Leave this area and do a running leap and grab onto the face of the cliff
Hang on and climb to the top and head right Backflip from the ledge to the slope and grab the edge as you fall off
Shimmy to the right and drop down to the platform to search the shack for Secret
Do a running jump from the platform back to the main path
Grab while in midair so you duck and won't hit your pretty head on the rocks
Return to the trail you were on before you went after this last secret You should arrive at another Kayak behind a closed gate
The switch to open the gate is under the water along with some nasty crocodiles
Kill the crocs then dive in and flip the switch to open the gate then climb aboard for some whitewater Kayaking Head through the gate after you have practiced all your moves
Back paddle to slow yourself through the first stretch of whitewater and steer toward the pool to the right
This small lagoon has a strong current of its own but you should be able to fight it long enough to steer into the alcove and get the Save Gem Back on the river head over the first falls and keep to the right to miss a big rock and a trip line
Continue around the bend and start back paddling when the current pulls you to the right
Trip the line to turn off the deadly blades then cruise over the next waterfall
Watch the big rock to the left and back paddle to keep your speed from getting out of control Keep back paddling as you steer towards the dark cave and follow it around to the right
Avoid the trip lines and keep back paddling to steer and monitor your speed
When you cross the final line back paddle and turn to make a sharp turn around the corner
Now paddle forward and head through the narrow gap
Dodge the patches of razor grass keeping to the left as you start the final run then let the current take you
You should end up in a large cavern Head to the cavern with a white waterfall and paddle behind the falls to find a Save Gem and some other items on the shore you can get later
You should have also just triggered Secret so you don't have to worry about any more secrets on this level
You can also get the Secret Chime by jumping over the falls to get those items on shore later but I assumed you wanted the Save Gem Now paddle down the green passage and put some distance between you and the hungry crocodile so you can exit the Kayak and get to shore before he bites you in half
Kill him from the safety of dry land then swing out over the cavern
Time your monkey swing so you don't get torched by those flaming faces then jump to the ledge and get the Rocket Launcher Go up the rock and follow the passage back to the cavern with the white waterfall
Do a running jump over the falls to get the ammo then head back down the shore and climb up onto the left ledge

Turn left and drop down at the wall and get the ammo from the shore on the left
Monkey swing back across the stream and jump around the corner to the slope
Jump to the ledge then jump back and grab the wall and climb up When you get outside look to the right for a tunnel and enter
Dodge the rolling boulder by ducking and letting them roll overhead
When you enter the room with the walkway walk out a short distance then back off the walkway and shimmy over the fire and pull up at the opposite end to avoid triggering the boulder
Jump over the flames in the hall and avoid the boulder that drops down rather quickly Back at the river you can run and jump to the ledge on the right and climb into the crawlspace
Once you are through this tight squeeze you can stand and jump over to the middle platform and do a running jump to the far ledge
Find and ride the cable slide down to the lower ledge and jump off to land on the ledge without taking any damage Climb the textured wall surface and watch for a dragon to attack from the right as you reach the top
Enter the hallway and flip the switch to pull the plug and light a torch which also summons another dragon
Return all the way back to your Kayak and head down the whirlpool
Try to stay to the edges otherwise you will drop to the bottom and probably die When you finally reach the lower area you will find an underwater switch that opens the exit and dumps a pair of angry crocs into the water with you
Get out of the water fast and kill them if you wish before leaving this level SOUTH PACIFIC ISLANDS Temple of PunaOur visit to the South Pacific Isles concludes with a small adventure into the Temple of Puna
You will start this level already under attack by hostile natives
Kill them quickly to avoid their poison darts
If you do get hit try to kill as many other natives as you can before using that medkit
Head to the lower area and check out the gate that leads to the final boss
Ignore it for now and make your way into the larger room with the boulder on the ramp More natives attack as you make your way up the stairs
Kill them all then when you reach the top duck down and crawl into the next deadly room
Rolling blades cross the room making things rather difficult
Jump from the upper ledge and sprint as the blades go by over to the right corner
Turn so your back is to the corner and you are looking out into the room
When the blades go by move over to hit the switch and return to the safety of your corner before the blades return Now you need to make a mad dash for the opposite end of the room
Line up with the axle on the blades and jump the gap between a set of blades and then sprint to the next corner
Repeat this process to flip all four switches
You may find it easier to backflip out of the corner so you are already facing the switch
This will save your precious seconds in lining up your approach to the switch and getting back to the safety of the corner The door will open after the forth button is pressed
Head to the safety of the door and then time your run back into the room to get the Save Gem as the blades roll off to the left
Roll as soon as your grab it and sprint back to the door Slide down the slope and into the next room where a spiked ceiling threatens our heroine
Three switches will stop the ceiling if you flip them fast enough but pulling out the box will do the same thing and with a lot less to panic about
Now that the ceilng is stopped flip the switches at your leisure to open the door
Do a safety drop down the hole and into the large chamber with the boulder trap Flip the switch to turn on the lights and seal the door
Sprint down the passage as the boulder is released and rumbles toward you
Sprint through the door and turn right making your way toward the Save Gem
Keep to the center otherwise the floor will collapse and you should finally reach safety between the two ramps
If you missed the Save Gem you can crawl back and get it now Back in the hall you will be attacked by a native on the right and two more on the left
Start up the stairs and when it reverses direction you should be able to spot an opening high above in the darkness
Jump from the steps over to the wall and shimmy to the left and into the opening to get Secret Finally go through the gate and slide down the slope to enter the boss's chamber
Puna will turn as you approach
When combat begins KEEP MOVING
He can only hit you if you are standing still
One hit and you are dead so just keep jumping around and you will be fine
Puna never gets out of his chair making him an easy target
Every so often he will summon some of his friends to assist him
Always kill them first before worrying about the boss
He will leave you alone as long as his help is still fighting for him
When Puna is no more grab the Medkit from the ledge and get the relic If you have been playing the game in the same order as I wrote this solve then you should have all four relics at this time
Pack your bags and get ready for a trip to Antarctica
Brrrrrrrr ANTARCTICA AntarcticaA brisk swim starts off the final part of your adventure
Don't stay in the water for long periods of time or hypothermia will set in
A new meter will show you how long you can stay in the icy water
Ammo is nearby if you want to take a dive to get it
Exit onto the shore and follow the coast past the locked hut
The level's final secret is in that hut but you will need to get a key first Jump over the water near the ship then take a quick swim and pull up to the icy ledge
Another swim puts you back on land near the front of the ship where you can climb the cliff to find the monkey swing above
Cross over then drop to the ledge and look for a hole in the ship's deck to get inside
Once inside you will have to battle some angry sailors as you make your way to the mechanical room A switch on the wall to the left of the machine will open a trapdoor
Drop through and continue down the corridors killing the attacking sailors
When you reach the next junction you should spot a hole in the ceiling to the left which leads out of the ship
Remember it but continue toward the orange pipe and kill another sailor before dropping through the trapdoor
Continue fighting off all these sailors as you head to the window where you should be able to spot a Zodiac small motorboat outside
Push the button to drop it into the water Now return to the hole in the ceiling and climb up and head to the rear of the ship
Head right when you reach the deck and follow the cliff
You should spot an opening in the cliff you can jump into to get Secret
Then make your way to the rear of the ship and jump into the Zodiac
This boat is even nicer than your speedboat from Venice
Maneuver the craft around the ship past the cliff and down the channel past the hut then get out when you reach the ledge inside the tunnel Light a flare and then slide jump and grab onto the ledge to check out the crawlspace
Head to the right to get Secret a Medkit then follow the crawlspace back and drop into the water
While you are wet you may as well get the ammo beneath you before climbing back into the boat Pilot the Zodiac deeper into the tunnel until it opens up and you arrive at a gate
Exit to the short and take care of the resistance you encounter
Monkey swing across the bars and head right at the junction before dropping down when the path ends
Continue down the passage killing the guards and guard dogs until you reach a building with an opening in the side
Press the button on the wall before moving off to the left and circle around the building Around the corner is a hole that you need to drop down into
Swim to the left and get out quickly near the fuel valves
Wade through the water you won't take damage over to the ladder and climb up to the generator room
The room is locked up so head outside and follow the path around to the left
Continue past the kennels and follow the path where you will meet a small army of goons and some annoying pit traps
Grab the ammo under the bridge by climbing down and exchanging a bit of gunfire
Then head back to the hole you originally dropped down to reach the fuel valves Enter the nearby cave and kill more guards as you make your way to the doors which will slam shut and try to kill you
Do a quick roll to get through the doors and continue killing the bad buys as you head upstairs to get the Crowbar
Return to the area with the hole leading to the valves and backtrack down the dark passage
Climb up into the raised building and flip the switch then pry open the door with the crowbar
Drop down and check out the map which shows which valves need to be adjusted to continue Return to the Generator Room and flip the switch to start the machines then return to the kennels and take care of the dogs before entering the building
Press all three buttons and get the Gate Key from the desk then return all the way back to the monkey swing where you parked the Zodiac
Go to the building you opened with the crowbar and use the Gate Key and press the button
More guards will arrive as you leave the building so be ready for them Get back in the boat and continue down the passage
You should spot a landing to the left
Park the boat and look for a hidden alcove below and to the right that contains the Hut Key

When you reach the cabin door you will exit this level ANTARCTICA RX Tech MinesProceed down the hall and go right running through each of the gates until you hear a second clicking noise
Turn around to find an open passage and head out to meet your first flamethrower guy
They aren't openly hostile unless you attack first so don't fire on them unless they fire on you FIRST Head to the first room where three mine carts and turn on the lights in the control room
Kill the mutant and watch out for their poison even after their death
Climb to the top of the control room and drop off the back to shimmy over to the ladder
Climb down the ladder so your feet are on the bottom rung and backflip with a twist to grab on behind you
Enter the small room to get Secret Head back to the previous room and get in the middle mine cart and take your first spin around the tracks
Try to keep your speed up for the approaching jump by leaning into the turns and keeping off the brake
Hit the track switch as you go by and exit the cart when it finally stops Crawl under the drills and search the crack over in the left wall then head out and around to the left
Kill a new species of mutant then drop down to the walkway before doing another safety drop to the next lower ledge
Shimmy along each of the cracks as far as you can go before dropping to the next one and reversing direction
When you reach the left side of the lowest crack you can pull up into a passage and move forward
More enemies await in the passage to be careful as you make your way to the large open area A new Crowbar rests on the metal ledge and more mutants are lurking about this area
Find the crawlspace in the wall near the mutants and investigate
Go to the rocks on the right then jump over to the cliff and shimmy over to the crawlspace and flip the switch inside
This opens up the door to the next secret that you can get in a few minutes Now proceed up the snowy slopes finding all the flat areas so you can make your way out of this area
Enter the passage and duck to avoid the obstacles and machines then head up the slope and kill the mutant waiting for you at the top
Return to the mine cart and flip the track switch so you can return to the main room with the other carts
Use the crowbar to open the stuck door and get the Lead Acid Battery Make a quick side trip back to the area where you got the first secret
A new door is now open in that same area and leads to Secret
Return to the main room and get ready for your next ride Get on the lower mine cart and head left building up lots of speed for the big jump coming up
Make sure duck under the various obstacles that threaten to decapitate our heroine
When the cart comes to a halt you can hop out and head down the passage to the lower hall
Kill all the attacking mutants before continuing and make sure to search the crawlspace under the walkway with the steam
Crawl through and kill the mutant and search the pool by the crane
The Winch Starter is on the bottom and you need to swim fast to survive the freezing water Return to the central mine cart room and take the final ride on the top mine cart
When the ride is over you should be at a crane that is holding a mini sub
Stick the battery in the appropriate slot and use the Winch Starter on the controls to lower the sub into the water
Dive in and get into the sub
You need to reach the surface of the next safe area and continue down between the lights and around to the right
Use Medkits when needed as your health will certainly be affected before you reach dry land Do not attack the flamethrower guy
Ignore him and drop to the ledge below the bridge and watch for mutants who are sneaking up behind you
In the chasm keep jumping back between the ledges until you reach the corner of the lower ledge which also triggers Secret
Retrace your steps back to the bridge and jump up and grab and pull up to enter the small building and end this level ANTARCTICA Lost City of TinnosExplore the Lost City when you first arrive then head to the upper level via the nearby ladder
Flip the switch to open the door below then jump to the central column to get the Save Gem
Drop down and enter the door and get the Uli key from the niche off the short hall
Use this key near the black grate in the courtyard to open the next area The ledge near the first switch you flipped has a second switch
Flip it then climb up and back into the building and cross over to the sloped hall and head down to find and flip another switch
You should now have access to a row of five switches Midas Flashback
so hit the proper combo to access the next area near the broken bridge
Another Save Gem awaits as well as giant wasps Climb the ledges by the Save Gem then jump over to the bridge and find the invisible ledges that lead to the wasps' nest
Do a running jump to get inside the nest and claim Secret while trying not to fall in the hole
Return to the bridge and jump over the break and follow the passage out and to the right
Don't forget to grab that medkit on the left as you leave Enter the green passage and kill everything that moves before arriving at the next tricky sequence
Swinging pots of fiery coals sway back and forth
Run past them making sure not to get burned
Enter the next area and head over to the ledge on the left to kill more wasps then continue in that direction
Further down the hall is another switch which summons three new monsters
When they are dead proceed down to the next switch which opens a crawlspace outside
Use the pillar to access this new area while dodging a few traps along the way This next area has a multitude of switches that raise and lower various platforms plus one of the switches is timed and leads to the next secret
Drop to the walkway and find the switch on the left wall
This is the switch to access the secret AFTER you get the door open Flip the switch on the ground floor then climb to the ledge that raises up
Flip that switch and move on to the next ledge until you can spot the platform under the walkway near the entrance
Make your way to this platform then jump up and monkey swing using the bottom of the walkway
Head over and flip the switch here to open the exit
Now return to the walkway and flip the secret switch Immediately after flipping this switch run back down the hall and drop off the walkway to the ledge on the left
Do a safety drop to the floor then move down the hall to flip the next switch which starts a timed door leading to the next secret
Run towards the column of light and head up the stairs to the right of the bright light and follow the passage down and to the left
Return past those swinging coals and head across the bridge
Jump off to the right and slide down the cliff to the bottom and get inside the door before it shuts
Inside is Secret a Save Gem
Flip the switch a couple times to get back out then return to the room with the column of light The light marks the center to the next four rooms
Each room contains a puzzle dealing with one of the four elements and when solved will reward you with a mask
Get all four masks and use them on the statues below to open the way to the boss
The Earth room is the easiest of the four and contains this level's final secret so we'll do that one first Keep to the right as you enter the Earth room which is full of quicksand
Get out onto solid ground after you pass the markings on the right wall
Take the first Oceanic Mask and watch as the ceiling starts to crumble
Getting back is a bit more difficult as the floor isn't as easy to navigate
Hop along the ledges on the wall and flip the switch to access the final secret after you leave then make one more leap around the corner to the sloped ledge and exit this room Return to the hall with the swinging coals and you should now see a block you can run and climb onto to get the FINAL SECRET in Tomb Raider Secret
Now return to the column of light and finish the remaining three rooms Let's do the Water room next
Start swimming and try to swim past the blades in the direction they are moving to minimize the damage
Swim down through the first of the blades to reach the clock and head to the left alcove to catch your breath and flip a switch
Head back to the clock and go through the hole to the right and up into a new area
Get more air and flip the next switch to open another door revealing the Oceanic Mask for this area
Get the mask and flip the next switch before returning to the clock
Fill up your lungs once more in the left alcove before going through the hole at the bottom of the clock
The current will pull you along into a shallow tunnel of water and eventually the exit The Wind room is just an annoying maze
Take the first right then go left then right and take the next left to the intersection
Head down the angled passage to the right but take the first left until you reach the crystal on the right
Take a left at the crystal and follow the hall to the next junction and turn right into the wider hall
Head up the ramp to the left and start jumping back and forth between the ledges to trigger the log trap
Make your way to the other end to claim the Oceanic Mask for this area The Fire room will bring back nightmares from the Midas level of the original Tomb Raider game but never fear this puzzle is much easier
Check out the map above your head which shows you the layout of this place then get ready to hop some blocks
There are also some invisible ledges which are made partially visible with the flaming dragon heads
Your goal is the ledge with the switch which will allow you to obtain the final Oceanic Mask assuming you did the rooms in their written order
If things get too hot remember you can hang from the ledges to regain your composure but getting up and onto the next ledge in time is very difficult Return to the lower room and place the four masks on the statues then claim the final Uli Key from the pool room and use it to open the nearby hall which leads to the Meteorite Cavern ANTARCTICA Meteorite CavernFighting the final boss isn't too bad when you know his secret
His most powerful weapon is his Death Ray which will quot Kill You No Questions Asked Immediately quot
He also never misses so the trick is to never let him fire it and he won't as long as you keep the meteor between you and him
So keep your distance and circle to stay on the opposite side as the spidery boss and keep firing To kill this monster you will have to collect the four meteor fragments from around this room
You will have to stun the Spider monster long enough to take each piece
Do this by firing on him until he freezes then get a piece and repeat
Always go for the nearest piece and one that is in a direction AWAY from the boss AND opposite the meteor
This means you may have to do some preliminary maneuvering to get him in the proper location before you stun him The boss moves in a counter clockwise direction around this room usually so after you retrieve a fragment make sure to head right when exiting the alcoves
When you have all four pieces the meteor will drop into the pool and you can now actually do DAMAGE to the boss
Finish him off Now that things are a bit more quiet climb the ladder to the top
Go past the carved face then drop down and backflip to the hand of the statue
Jump over to the middle ledge and follow the passage to the left
You arrive high above the cavern and can monkey swing over to the next ledge
From there jump to the rocky ledge and climb up and outside
Slide down the snowy slope and turn right Kill any resistance that is still hanging around before pushing the button on the wall
Head through the gate to spot an approaching helicopter
Approach the helicopter to end the level and Lara's main adventure in Tomb Raider BONUS LEVEL All HallowsIt all boils down to this the BONUS LEVEL accessible only if you got all secrets or used the Cheat Code
Save your game after the final level then load up this final test of your endurance
Keep in mind you start this level with no inventory and you MUST be at FULL HEALTH later on in the level so be careful Start by climbing the metal ledges and make your way to the center structure
Do a running jump to the slope and get the Flares then jump to the center platform and monkey swing out over the cathedral ceiling and drop
CRASH
I told you you needed to be healthy
Limp over to the Medkit on the landing and fix yourself up
Get the next batch of Flares from the purple platform then move to the walkway above the bookshelf A switch is in the alcove above the bookcase
Flip it then drop down to the floor and climb up and jump to the central structure then do a running jump and grab to the ledge and shimmy left to flip the next switch in the upper alcove
A hall should now be open back on the floor level Head down this hall and run across the floor as it falls out beneath behind you and flip the switch at the end
Return to the main room via the monkey swing which takes you over the spikes below
Return to the bookcase and get on the ledge so you can monkey swing to the left
Drop and immediately grab so you can pull up to the small area at the other end of the monkey swing and climb above the cable slide Get the Vault Key then take a ride down the slide
Make sure to drop off just as you slide into the light to land safely
Pull up onto the area above the pillar then drop and hang off the other side to spot an open door
Take the monkey swing across as you catch on fire then drop into the water ahead to put out the flames
Swim past the piston and push the button then grab the Medkit from the ledge to the right Above the ladder do a quick roll and grab the edge to trigger but not fall through the trap door
Jump across the hole and head to the vault
Use the key to open it up and shoot out the grates before dropping into the water
When you finally surface you will find a guard dog and his master

The End GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
by Stella Lara Croft OnlineLCO HOME CAVE Pick up the Uzi clips sets to the left and right of the starting position
Climb up the blocks to the trapdoor in the ceiling
Jump to grab the switch at the edge of the trapdoor to open it
This works best if you stand Lara directly under the switch facing out toward the cave
Then jump straight up pressing Action to grab
Climb through the trapdoor to the desert above DESERT NEAR THE PYRAMID A gigantic red scorpion attacks almost immediately
A few shotgun blasts will take it down but try not to let it get too close
In addition to causing damage its sting is poisonous
Head downhill to the intersection of paths
Off to the left south there's another giant scorpion attacking a soldier
The soldier is friendly enough if you don't harm him but if you do kill him you'll get some extra revolver ammo
Backtrack to the intersection then go left west
Pick up a large med pack ahead on the left
Then come back to the intersection again
Turn left north toward the deep pit Take a running jump across the pit on the left side
Follow the path between the rocks
There's another giant scorpion around the corner to the right
Kill it and continue to the break in the wall on the north side
You'll need to cross another chasm to get to the base of the pyramid
Take a running jump across the pit on the right side to grab the ledge
Pull up
Now you'll have to kill another giant scorpion along with one of those huge nasty beetles AT THE BASE OF THE PYRAMID You'll notice some enticing flat areas on the face of the pyramid just begging you to climb them
Wait for just a little while and you'll be able to save yourself a bit of backtracking
For now head to the right east side of the pyramid toward another deep excavation pit with a building on the other side BUILDING WITH GUARD UNDER SIEGE To get across the pit you can use a complicated series of jumps across the angled blocks as in the second secret in the City of the Dead level
Or to simplify things stand Lara at the northwest rim of the pit where the rim juts out over the pit in a small square ledge
Face south and take a running jump to grab the back of the angled block ahead as shown in the screenshot at http stellalune com TR walk screenshots menkaure jpg
Pull up slide down the back of the block and jump to land on a flat spot ahead
Kill another giant beetle off to the left east Save your game before entering the building
The outcome of the next fight will determine whether or not you get a secret later in the game
BUG NOTE A bug has also been reported here in which after the cut scene Lara loses the ability to move her arms and so can't climb or draw weapons
There are some suggestions for avoiding this bug at the end of this document
Use the Action key to open the door
Inside you'll find a guard being attacked by a giant scorpion
Your mission should you choose to accept it is to kill the scorpion before it can kill the guard
In order to avoid targeting the guard run into the room and around to the left side of the scorpion
Then start firing
You'll want to use a fairly powerful weapon so the huge insect won't have time to kill its prey
The bug mentioned above seems to be triggered by using the shotgun so try the revolver or Uzis
If you succeed a movie plays Cut scene The scorpion flings the guard against the wall as Lara now using pistols finishes it off
She kneels by the injured guard Guard quot Allah be praised
For a moment I thought I was dead for sure
Please for your own safety take these keys and hide in the pyramid of Menkaure
Save yourself from these abominations quot If you check your inventory now you'll see that you have not only THE GUARD'S KEYS but also the ARMORY KEY which you'll use later to access the secret in the KHUFU'S QUEEN'S PYRAMIDS level
If the guard is killed in the fight with the scorpion you can pick up the GUARD'S KEYS but you do not get the ARMORY KEY Go around to each of the corner alcoves and pick up regular and wideshot shotgun shells and small med packs before exiting the building The excavation pit on the right east prevents you from getting to the two smaller pyramids
You will get there in the next level
For now go back across the pit on the left Jump up to grab the edge of the sandy colored rock outcropping on the right side of the pit
Then traverse to the left around the corner and across the pit
When you can't go any farther to the left let go and slide onto a flat spot near the far north edge of the pit CLIMBING THE PYRAMID The following sequence is illustrated in the screenshots at http tombraiders net stella TR walk menkaure html
The numbers in this text refer to the numbers on those screenshots
Walk up onto the low flat block at the base of the pyramid on the right east end
From here you can get to another flat spot one tier above
At the left side of this flat spot climb onto another flat spot on the tier above
Kill the giant beetle
Now you'll need to take a diagonal standing jump up and to the left to the next flat spot
Jump from the middle of the ledge at the left side
At this point you'll be on a long flat spot on the third tier from the ground
Take a running jump along the bottom edge of this flat spot toward the left west side of the pyramid
You'll land on a slope and slide down to a long flat area two tiers below
At this point you'll need to kill another giant beetle
Now start working your way up the left side
Walk to the left end of this flat spot
From here you can climb up two tiers
Climb up three more tiers at the right side of this ledge
Now you should be level with the doorsill
You may be able to kill a giant beetle lurking in the doorway
If not you'll need to do it when you get there
Take a running jump along the bottom edge of this flat spot to land near the doorway
NOTE For running jumps along the pyramid line up each jump so Lara takes off just a tiny bit before the edge or she'll nick her foot on it and end up doing a standing jump instead
Also be sure not to press Action while in the air which shortens the jump
You're at the door now and if you've followed this walkthrough you've got the GUARD'S KEYS
First unlock the door since you'll need to make a speedy exit in a moment
Now take a brief detour for a secret
This sequence is shown in the screenshots at http tombraiders net stella TR walk menkaure html
Hop down onto the flat spot below the right side of the door left side if you're facing out from the pyramid
Take a diagonal standing jump up to the next flat spot
Jump from the middle of the ledge at the right side
Or if this particular jump is too difficult instead take a running jump along the bottom edge of the lower flat spot to land on another flat spot on the same tier a bit farther on
Kill the giant beetle that flies up at you
Then turn back toward the doorway and climb up two tiers three if you made the alternate jump Now you should be on the tier above the door
Take a standing jump over the slope to the ledge on the right side of the door where you'll find a small med pack
Take a running jump to the ledge on the other side of the door
Pick up the REVOLVER or ammo if you already have the weapon which is secret
When you do a swarm of beetles comes out of the pyramid
To escape them drop down and run through the doors into the pyramid
The beetles will follow but only as far as the load in to the next level LEVEL INSIDE MENKAURE'S PYRAMID Secrets HALL WITH SWINGING BLADES Head down the ramp killing a bat as you go
To get through the swinging blade position Lara at either side close to the blade but not too close and run through as the blade starts to swing toward the other side
Repeat the process for the second blade
And kill a few more bats in the room beyond STAIRS DOWN TO ROOM WITH HUGE BASIN Start down the stairs
About a third of the way down Lara will look up at a recessed spot the ceiling containing a gold star
Use the revolver or crossbow normal arrows with the laser sight to target the star
One shot should break it opening a trapdoor in the room below
Continue down the stairs a little farther and you'll see mummies shambling around near a white marble basin
If you wait for them to move near each other you can destroy both with a single grenade or explosive arrow
Other weapons are ineffective
Switch to pistols then enter the room and kill another bat
Pick up the revolver ammo on the floor behind the basin PITS WITH CONCEALED SPIKES AND DANGLING ROPES Stand on the edge of the low platform supporting the basin
Take a standing jump diagonally over the edge of the basin to get into it
Drop through the trapdoor you opened by shooting the star
Follow the ramp down to a large pit filled with concealed spikes that has a rope dangling above it Take a running jump to grab the rope
Scoot down to the bottom and swing across the pit jumping off the rope to land on the opposite ledge
The next room contains more mummies and a bat
If you Advance slowly toward the entrance you can destroy the mummies without triggering the bat
Then switch to pistols go in and look for the bat on the left Beyond this are two more pits with concealed spikes and ropes
First swing across the pit on the right Take a running jump to grab the first rope
Climb to the bottom then swing and jump to grab the second rope
Climb to the bottom of that rope then swing and jump to the doorway
Go up the ramp and use the switch to open a trapdoor elsewhere
Swing back across the spike pit Go around the corner to the second pit
Repeat the rope swinging business to get across this pit
Go up the ramp to the trapdoor you just opened
A hawk headed guardian perhaps a minion of Horus
waits in the room above
When you climb through the opening he begins to shoot energy bolts from his staff
It isn't too hard to dodge them if you immediately start flipping from side to side while firing
You can use any weapons you like but grenades or explosive arrows work fast
When he is destroyed use your CROWBAR to pry the WESTERN SHAFT KEY from the wall with the huge star
NOTE Alternately you can climb into the room run across and get the key then run back to the trapdoor using med packs as needed
Once you get the key and escape the guardian won't follow
Cut scene Taking the key also causes a block to recede elsewhere revealing a doorway Return down the ramp to the spike pit
Swing back across the pit then back across the first pit the one with only one rope
Go back up the ramp and jump out of the basin in the room at the foot of the stairs
Go upstairs and turn right east to find the door that just opened Enter and slide down the ramp to a dark tunnel
Crawl along the long straight passage to avoid the converging horizontal blades
Go around the corner and up the ramp to a trapdoor in the ceiling
Jump straight up to grab the switch at the edge of the door to open it
Climb through the trapdoor to the desert above
NOTE You'll probably recognize this area from the previous level
The building where you rescued the guard from the scorpion is off to the south beyond the deep excavation pit
OUTDOORS NEAR TWO SMALLER PYRAMIDS Two giant scorpions attack almost immediately
You can use the tunnel opening for cover if necessary
When the scorpions get too close drop back into the opening and they'll soon lose interest
Then you can climb out and start shooting again
When you've killed both go between the two pyramids and find the button in the small alcove on the left
Press this to open up the top of the other pyramid
This also releases another giant scorpion Climbing the pyramid is a bit of a challenge
Save your game first since any misstep will likely result in Lara's sliding into the excavation pit
Refer to the screenshot at http stellalune com TR walk screenshots smallpyramid jpg if necessary
The numbers in this text refer to the numbers on the picture
Walk onto the flat spot at the bottom left of the pyramid
From here you can climb up one tier
Take a running jump across the sloped section to the right landing on the next flat spot on the same level
From here you can climb up two more tiers
Walk onto the flat step to the right then climb onto the ledge at the very top center of the pyramid
Turn around drop back and catch the edge of the opening
Then climb down the ladder into the pyramid INSIDE THE SMALL PYRAMID Go up the ramp to a spike pit
Take a running jump across
Use the monkey bars on the ceiling to traverse across the next deep pit
The next pit is a wide one with concealed spikes and a swinging blade
To get across position Lara facing the pit and close to either of the side walls
Take a running jump to grab the opposite side of the pit starting to run when the blade reaches your side
By the time you get to the blade it will have swung away
Pull up and continue Around the corner you'll need to repeat the running jump across a second spike and blade pit
On the other side there's a deep pit with monkey bars off to the left and another spike and blade pit ahead
First go across the spike and blade pit
Around the next corner is a chain
Pull it to open a gate elsewhere
Return across the spike pit then use the monkey bars on the ceiling to traverse across the deep pit on the right
Continue to the gate you opened using the chain LARGE CAVE WITH SLOPE AND SPIKES Save your game first if you like
You may need to try this bit more than once to get the secret
Slide down the slope jumping to the right at the end to land in the one safe spot in the spike pit or on the tiny triangular ledge just above this safe spot
Pick up the UZIS Uzi clips if you already have the weapons
This is secret
Climb out of the pit onto the triangular ledge and continue sliding through the small square opening at the bottom of the cave You'll find yourself in the passageway where you began the level UNDERNEATH THE SPHINX
At the bottom of the hill is the HALL WITH BULL GUARDIANS AND HIEROGLYPH BUTTONS the gate is still closed
Go to the top of the slope to re enter the SPHINX COMPLEX level SPHINX COMPLEX EXCAVATION PITS REVISITED Climb out of the pit between the sphinx's paws
Go to the right west around the corner which is the right paw of the SPHINX toward the excavation pit
Take a running jump from the triangular flat spot at the left side of the pit near the wall
Tap the left directional key while in the air necessary to land near the stone gate supports
Use the GUARD'S KEYS which you should still have from the MENKAURE'S PYRAMID level to unlock the doors
Go through the dark opening to finish the level IMPORTANT NOTE Do not leave this level without the WESTERN SHAFT KEY
Since taking it opens the exit this shouldn't be a problem unless you use the level skip cheat
You will need this key along with three others when you get to the level INSIDE THE GREAT PYRAMID
Once you enter the next level THE MASTABAS you won't be able to backtrack to this level LEVEL THE MASTABAS Secrets NOTE See the FYI at the end of this document for more on mastabas
The diagram above shows the layout of this level and the beginning of the next THE GREAT PYRAMID
The thick gray lines represent the above ground buildings
The broken lines show the underground rooms and tunnels
The rooms are numbered in both diagram and text in the order you explore them
Special thanks to Theresa from tombraiders com for this diagram used with permission GAS STATION AND FIRST MASTABA and in the diagram As you explore a wild dog comes out from between the two buildings ahead and to the left
There's another dog slinking around the truck parked by the gas station a little farther to the left north
After clearing the area pick up the JERRYCAN near the gas pumps
Return to the boarded up door with the quot Danger quot sign near where you began the level
Shoot the boards enter the building and kill a couple of bats
It looks like there's nothing here but wait
There's a cleverly concealed trapdoor in the middle of the floor
Lighting a flare might help you spot it
It's the one square that's divided into smaller squares
Position Lara facing this square standing just outside it with her back to the entrance
As in the screenshot at http stellalune com TR walk screenshots mastabas jpg
Press Action to lift the trapdoor
Climb down the ladder to the bottom of the shaft where you'll find a large med pack
This is secret
Climb back out of the pit

Drop into the tunnel and kill a wild dog
Follow the tunnel
At the split go left east
Continue to a room with more dogs
ROOM WITH THREE GOLDEN LIONS' HEADS Pick up normal arrows and a small med pack from the floor
Use the pistols to shoot each of the gems in the lions' mouths
You don't need to waster revolver ammo here
Instead draw pistols stand Lara in front of each lion's head and jump while shooting
When all of the gems are broken the door will open
There are mummies lurking in the alcove
You can destroy both with a single grenade or explosive arrow
Other weapons are ineffective
Go into the alcove and pick up the SMALL WATERSKIN Follow the tunnel back to the split
This time head left south
You'll meet more dogs as you go
At the end of the passage climb through the opening in the ceiling to another ruined mastaba
SOUTHWEST MASTABA Kill bats and a black scorpion normal size
Exit and go the right east
You'll meet a wild dog just around the corner
Take a running jump across the excavation pit to the building with the quot Danger quot sign

Open the trapdoor and hop down into the pit
Follow the tunnel and when it forks go right east
ANOTHER ROOM WITH THREE GOLDEN LIONS' HEADS Kill wild dogs and a bat
I found it helped to advance slowly down the stairs to trigger only the dogs deal with them using the shotgun then switch to pistols and enter the room to kill the bat
Now repeat the business of shooting the gems in the lions' mouths see ROOM WITH THREE GOLDEN LIONS' HEADS above
The same as before when you shatter all the gems the alcove door opens releasing mummies
Only this time there are also more bats which make targeting a bit more difficult
I recommend first using a grenade which should take care of the mummies then switching over to pistols for the bats if they're still alive
Pick up the BAG OF SAND in the alcove Return along the passage to the fork
This time go right north
You will soon come to two left turns one after the other
There's a wild dog waiting here
Take the first left kill another dog just around the corner and continue to a dead end where you'll find a large med pack and revolver ammo
Return to the intersection and turn left then left again
Continue to an opening where you can climb up
WEST CENTRAL MASTABA Shoot several bats inside the ruined tomb
Then shoot the boards across the door and exit
Take a running jump across the excavation pit to the small ledge at the corner of the next building on the right northwest
Take a standing jump from there to the ledge in front of the building
Use the directional keys to pivot in the air if necessary to help land these tricky jumps
NORTHWEST CENTRAL MASTABA Enter the building and kill scorpions
Open the trapdoor and drop down into the tunnel
Follow the tunnel turning right west at the T intersection
Kill the wild dog in the passage and pick up the WOODEN TORCH at the end
Return eastward along the passage past turn where you came in from the surface
When you come to the stairs leading down to the next room drop the torch and draw weapons
Remember where you left the torch since you'll be needing it shortly
ANTEROOM WITH GOLDEN LIONS' HEADS ROOM WITH THREE SCALES Kill dogs and bats
Again I found it easier to trigger the dogs first use the shotgun to kill them then switch to pistols and enter the room to kill the bats
Then repeat the process of shooting the gems in the lions' mouths to open the door see ROOM WITH THREE GOLDEN LIONS' HEADS above
Enter the next room and kill more bats
Here is a puzzle involving three scales
These are labeled with symbols for water wavy blue lines fire sun and earth pyramid Walk around behind the scales and stand Lara in the small pool
Select the SMALL WATERSKIN from your inventory and press Action to fill it with water
Return to the front of the scales step up onto the low platform and position Lara in front of the scale with the water symbol
Use the filled waterskin to pour water into the scale Next position Lara in front of the scale with the sun symbol
Pour gasoline from the JERRYCAN into the scale
Go back through the LIONS' HEADS room to get the WOODEN TORCH from where you dropped it
Light it on one of the lit torches and use it to ignite the gasoline in the scale
NOTE If you're missing the jerrycan you'll need to go back to the beginning of the level to do this
If you're missing the torch it's just down the hall a bit
Go through the ROOM WITH GOLDEN LIONS' HEADS and follow the hallway westward to a dead end where you'll find the torch on the ground
Finally position Lara in front of the scale with the pyramid symbol
Use the BAG OF SAND to pour sand into the scale
After filling all three scales correctly the left west door in the SCALE ROOM opens
Enter the WEST ROOM in the diagram and kill the mummies
Use the CROWBAR to pry the NORTHERN SHAFT KEY off the wall
When you do the east door in the SCALE ROOM opens
Go through the SCALE ROOM into the EAST ROOM in the diagram
Pick up poison arrows and revolver ammo near the ramp
Kill the dogs in the stairway opposite and exit up these stairs Follow the passage
After a few bends take the first left and continue to a dead end where there's a large med pack
Here wild dogs attack from behind
Backtrack to the intersection turn left and continue to the opening in the ceiling where you can climb out of the tunnel
NOTE Before exiting this area you can also shoot some more gems in the other lions' mouths and relight the torches that go out
However I haven't found that this accomplishes anything
NORTHEAST CENTRAL MASTABA Kill a black scorpion in the ruined building exit and kill another scorpion outside
Take a running jump to the north side of the excavation pit tapping the left directional key in flight to land the jump
Turn right an take a running jump across the pit to grab the rim on the south side
Be sure to jump across at the left side where the ledges are closer together
See the yellow area with arrows in the diagram
SOUTHEAST CENTRAL MASTABA Open the door of the building on the right southwest enter and kill several bats
Open the trapdoor and drop down into the tunnel
You might want to walk along this tunnel with pistols drawn since Lara can probably see the scorpions before you do
You'll encounter three of them as you go
The first is just inside the tunnel
Turn left north at the first and only intersection
Continue to another scorpion and a little farther on some revolver ammo
Follow the tunnel back to the intersection then go left east
Kill another scorpion and continue to where you can climb out into another ruined mastaba
SOUTHEAST MASTABA There's a wild dog lurking in the doorway
Just outside is another boarded up ruin
NORTHEAST MASTABA Shoot the boards kick open the door and enter
Kill bats and open the trapdoor
Follow the tunnel to a T intersection
To the right is an obvious dead end
There's a small med pack on the ground here
when you pick it up a dog attacks from behind
Continue eastward to yet another ANTEROOM WITH GOLDEN LIONS' HEADS
Take care of the twin dogs and twin bats and shoot the gems to open the door
Is it just me or is this getting a little tedious
ROOM WITH MONKEY STATUES Here we have something a little different
Three monkey statues in the classic poses quot hear no evil quot quot see no evil quot and quot speak no evil quot Each statue has a lever mechanism in front of it
You'll need to use the CROWBAR as a handle to operate each lever
If you like you can avoid using all but the lever on the right
This one releases a friendly monkey that climbs up onto the high ledge and uses the switch there to open the door to the right east If curiosity overrides compassion you can release the other monkeys just to check them out
Use the CROWBAR to operate each of the other lever mechanisms
The one on the left quot hear no evil quot releases a black monkey that attacks Lara
The middle lever quot see no evil quot releases a ghostly monkey which also attacks Lara
These guys make nice little explosions when you kill them
NOTE If you accidentally kill the friendly monkey before it can open the door use the crowbar again to operate the lever on the right
On the PC version at least you'll need to position Lara facing the lever mechanism from the other side i e with her back to the statue
The monkey will appear again and climb the wall to pull the switch
The EAST ROOM contains mummies
If you wait for them to move near each other you can destroy both with a single grenade or explosive arrow
When the area is clear go in and pry the SOUTHERN SHAFT KEY off the wall
When you do the west door in the MONKEY ROOM opens
Go through the MONKEY ROOM into the WEST ROOM
Again you can shoot the gems if you like but I found this didn't do anything
Follow the passage out of the west room and follow the passage to the end of the level IMPORTANT NOTE Do not leave this level without three shaft keys
The first the WESTERN SHAFT KEY you should have found in the last level INSIDE MENKAURE'S PYRAMID
The other two the NORTHERN and SOUTHERN SHAFT KEYS you should have found here in the MASTABAS
You'll get the EASTERN SHAFT KEY in the next level KHUFU'S QUEEN'S PYRAMIDS
You will need all of the keys when you get to the level INSIDE THE GREAT PYRAMID
Once you enter the next level you won't be able to backtrack to this level LEVEL THE GREAT PYRAMID Secrets NOTE The diagram at the beginning of the Mastabas walkthrough above covers the previous level but also includes the four tombs at the beginning of this level
MASTABAS Follow the tunnel from the MASTABAS level and climb out into another ruined tomb number in the diagram
Pick up a small med pack and shotgun shells in the corners
Use your pistols shoot the boards in the doorway then quickly draw some more powerful weapons to kill the blue robed bad guy waiting outside Across the excavation pit to the left west is another bad guy
If you like you can kill him from here with the crossbow
To save ammo use the laser sight bug described in the COASTAL RUINS walkthrough
Take a running jump across the pit to the left south side
Run to the doorway for cover because another guy is shooting from across the pit on the north side
Again you can take him out from here using the crossbow or revolver Kick down the door of this building
In addition to the human enemy waiting inside there's also a giant beetle
After you clear the room find the concealed trapdoor in the floor
Lighting a flare might help you spot it
It's the one square that's divided into smaller squares
Position Lara facing west standing just outside the edge of the trapdoor as in the screenshot at http stellalune com TR walk screenshots mastabas jpg which is actually from the MASTABAS level but is nearly identical
Press Action to lift the trapdoor
Climb down the ladder to the bottom of the shaft where you'll find the GRENADE GUN or grenades if you already have the weapon
This is secret
Climb back out of the pit Exit through the door on the left north
There may be a bad guy waiting here if you didn't kill him earlier from across the pit
Shoot the boards to get into the next building
Enter and kill another blue robed guy
Avoid the trapdoor which only contains a deep pit
Exit through the door in the northeast corner Across the deep chasm you can see the GREAT PYRAMID
Before going on make one more stop at the building around the corner to the right
Blow the boards away enter and kill a couple of giant beetles
Pick up Uzi clips and grenades in the corners
Then open the trapdoor to get a large med pack
Exit the way you came and approach the PYRAMID
Cut scene A panoramic view of the face of the pyramid SCALING THE PYRAMID Now it's all about climbing
Your goal is the bottom of the pyramid on the far left west side but naturally there is no direct route
Instead you must make your way across the pyramid to the right east in order to climb higher then back to the west
NOTE If you need visual aids to help you with the climb see the series of screenshots at http tombraiders net stella TR walk greatpyramid html
The numbers given in the text refer to the labels on the screenshots
Places where giant beetles appear are marked with green B's in the screenshots
Places where falling blocks are triggered are marked with red X's
For running jumps along the pyramid line up each jump so Lara takes off just a tiny bit before the edge or she'll nick her foot on it and end up doing a standing jump instead
Also be sure not to press Action while in the air unless it's necessary since this shortens the jump
Take a running jump from the jutting ledge across the deep chasm to grab the opposite ledge at the base of the pyramid
Turn left west and slide down the slope to the flat ledge
From there take another running jump to grab the ledge ahead which also juts out below the base of the pyramid
Pull up
Climb up to the first tier of the pyramid and kill a giant beetle
Climb up one more tier
You should now be on a flat area of the pyramid two squares wide and two tiers up from the base
Turn to the right east and take a running jump along the second tier over two slippery blocks to land on the flat block beyond
Immediately move Lara to the top edge of the flat spot and duck to avoid a deadly falling block
After the falling block passes overhead take a standing jump from the middle of the flat block over a slippery block to another flat block
Repeat this to get to the next flat spot and immediately duck to avoid another falling block
Climb up one tier
You should now be on the third tier of the pyramid
Turn to the right east and take a standing jump from the middle of the flat block over a slippery block to another flat block
Repeat this to get to the next flat spot which is two squares long
Take a running jump to land on a slippery spot three squares ahead and slide down the pyramid to a flat spot three tiers below
Move close to the top edge to avoid a falling block
Climb down to the ledge below which juts out over the chasm
From here take a running jump across the chasm to grab the flat square block on the other side
Pull up
Turn left east and kill the giant beetle on the steeply angled block a little farther along the wall of the chasm
Take a running jump to land on that steeply angled block
You'll need to line up this jump carefully since only the narrow triangular top of the starting ledge is flat enough to stand on safely
Be sure to run along the right side of the block close to the wall
Turn to face across the chasm north and take a running jump to grab the lower of the brown steps on the other side of the gap
The edge is hard to see because the rocks blend into each other
I've marked it in green on the screenshot
Climb up to the higher brown block
Then climb to the sandy ledge above and immediately duck or hop back down to the lower block as a falling block sails overhead
Turn right east and take a diagonal standing jump down to the block with the large med pack
Jump back to the previous ledge
Now position Lara at the left side of the flat spot facing uphill but angled a little to the left
Take a standing jump to the next flat spot on the tier above
Repeat the same type of jump to the next flat spot on the tier above that one
You should now be on the third tier from the bottom
Take a standing jump from the middle of the flat block over a slippery block to another flat block in the same tier
This triggers the appearance of another giant beetle
Climb up two tiers
Turn right east and take a standing jump over a slippery block to another flat block
Repeat this to get to the next flat spot and duck to avoid another falling block
Climb up two tiers to a long flat spot walk along this flat spot to the left west and kill a pair of beetles on the next long ledge above and to the left
Climb up to this ledge and walk across it to the left west end
From the end of the long ledge where the beetles were take a running jump to land on the third slippery square ahead and slide down to a flat spot three squares below
Face west and take a running jump over two slippery blocks to land on the flat block beyond
Kill another beetle
Now you have a choice of paths
Do not climb up because after that the next running jump will land you on a square with a falling block that's impossible to avoid
Instead take a standing jump from the middle of the flat block over a slippery block to the next flat block in the same tier
Take a diagonal standing jump down to the next flat spot
Turn to face up the slope and take another diagonal standing jump up and to the left to the next flat spot
Once again take a diagonal standing jump down to the next flat spot
Turn to face up the slope and once again take a diagonal standing jump up and to the left to the next flat spot
Here you'll be attacked by another beetle
Climb up three tiers
Position Lara facing up the slope and take another diagonal standing jump up and to the left to the next flat spot
Take a standing jump over a slippery block to the next flat block in the same tier
Duck to avoid a falling block
Then do another standing jump to the next flat spot
From here take a running jump to land on the third slippery square ahead and slide down into the next level LEVEL KHUFU'S QUEEN'S PYRAMIDS Secrets OUTSIDE NEAR BUNKER When you round the corner after sliding down the face of the GREAT PYRAMID you meet soldiers fighting a giant scorpion
Another scorpion joins the battle as you approach
If you can help the soldiers without accidentally shooting either of them they won't attack you
Remember to tap the Look key to make Lara aim at each of the available targets in turn
There's no particular reward for saving the soldiers it's just the right thing to do
On the south side of this open area is a stone BUNKER
The two ramps at the front each lead down to a door
Go down the ramp to the left door and press Action to open it
Enter and shoot the various wooden crates to get a load of supplies a small med pack wideshot shells Uzi clips normal grenades revolver ammo poison arrows and super grenades Go back up the ramp down the ramp on the right and through the other door
The crates on the right are empty
Use the ARMORY KEY to unlock the wrought iron gate
Inside is secret crates containing a small armory indeed normal arrows a SHOTGUN UZIS a CROSSBOW a GRENADE GUN shotgun shells and a REVOLVER or ammo for these if you've got the weapons
NOTE If you saved the soldier from the giant scorpion in the MENKAURE'S PYRAMID level he will have given Lara the ARMORY KEY
If not then you will be unable to get this secret
When you go back up the ramp you'll encounter another soldier tussling with another giant scorpion
Help the poor guy if you can Then approach the deep pit to the north between the GREAT PYRAMID and the two smaller pyramids
NOTE The sequence of jumps is illustrated in the series of screenshots at http tombraiders net stella TR walk khufu html
First jump to the small square ledge on the left west side of the pit
Take a running jump angled to the left to land in the space between the two small pyramids
Don't aim for the small ledge jutting out into the pit it's too far away and Lara will fall
Kill another giant scorpion that charges out of the gap between the pyramids taking care not to hop back into the pit Take a running jump from the jutting ledge across the pit to grab the ledge on the opposite side
From there take a standing jump to the block ledge on the right south
Kill the giant beetle that buzzes in then climb onto the ledge above
Turn right north and take a running jump to the small ledge protruding from the sandy side of the pyramid
Don't try to grab or Lara won't make it
Walk to the corner of the ledge the pit is on Lara's left and take a standing jump to the next ledge ahead which is steeply angled but still flat enough for Lara to stand on
Now take a running jump across the pit to grab the protruding ledge on the other side
Pull up and turn right north
From here you should be able to kill the giant beetle sitting on the rock ledge ahead
Take a running jump to the ledge where the beetle was and get ready to fight the giant scorpion that comes around the corner from between the pyramids
If you don't kill the beetle first you have to deal with both at the same time
Go to the back of the space between the two small pyramids and you'll find a small med pack
Now locate the movable boulder nearby and push it as far as you can to the west away from the pit onto the faint carved bird symbol
This causes a door to open in the small pyramid just to your left
Enter open the trapdoor and climb down the ladder into KHUFU'S QUEEN'S PYRAMIDS THE MAZE The diagram above may help you navigate this maze
The layout is fairly simple but getting through it is complicated by the stone blocks that raise and lower when you step on certain pressure pads in the floor
The result is that each hallway can only be traveled in one direction
In the diagram each block is marked with an arrow showing the direction you must travel in order to pass the block
The blocks along the path in and out of the maze are numbered in both diagram and text In addition there are small rectangular niches at various points on the walls also indicated in the diagram
Some of these contain goodies but most contain swarms of beetles
If you trigger the beetles you can either run away or reload a saved game Enter the maze and the gate closes behind you
At the first intersection turn left east
When you step on the first pressure pad the block ahead recedes
Kill the black scorpion in the passageway then advance just as far as the second niche on the right hand wall
Inside you'll find some Uzi clips
The first niche contains beetles so don't reach in
Don't go any farther or you'll step on the next pressure pad raising the block and sealing the passage behind you
Instead backtrack westward to the intersection near the gate Continue straight ahead west
Stepping on the pressure pad just beyond the intersection makes the block ahead recede
Kill another black scorpion in the passageway
Reach into the first niche on the left for a small med pack
Skip the second niche which contains beetles
Continue stepping on the next pad which raises the block behind you
Turn the corner to go south
The next pressure pad lowers the block ahead and you'll need to shoot another scorpion
Continue southward to the next intersection
Turn right west and follow the passage lowering and raising a block as you go
When you turn the corner to head south again you'll see two torches and two niches
Avoid the niches as both contain beetles
Around the next corner you'll turn eastward here you'll step on a pad which lowers the block ahead and you'll encounter another scorpion in the hall beyond At the next intersection turn left north
The next block will come down but go just as far as the first niche where you'll find more Uzi clips
After getting them backtrack to the south to the intersection you just passed
Continue straight on southward lowering and raising another block as you go and killing the scorpion ahead in the passageway
Round the corner to the east
Continue eastward raising yet another block as you go
Skip the two niches both have beetles inside and turn right south at the next intersection GUARDIAN'S ROOM Ready weapons before stepping on the next pressure pad
When the block ahead comes down you'll be face to face with the hawk headed guardian in the next room
I recommend using grenades or explosive arrows about seven should do the trick and shooting from the doorway
The energy bolts he fires from his staff aren't too powerful if you keep your distance
Also black scorpions emerge from behind the pillars when you enter the room
Better to deal with them after disposing of the guardian Use your CROWBAR to pry the EASTERN SHAFT KEY from the wall with the huge star
NOTE Alternately you can run into the room get the key then run back to the hallway and to the right
Once you get beyond the raising and lowering block the guardian can't follow
If you choose this path you might want to get the large med pack in the niche before going into the guardian's room since you won't have time to get it on the way out
Cut scene Taking the key causes the gate to open back at the entrance to the maze Now return through the maze Exit the guardian's room and turn right east at the first intersection
The block lowers as you approach and you'll need to kill another scorpion at the end of the passage
Reach into the first niche on the left for a large med pack
Avoid the second niche which has only beetles
Turn the corner to head north
When the next block comes down shoot another scorpion a little farther along the passage
Continue straight north through the next intersection raising yet another block and killing another scorpion as you go
This section of hallway also contains two niches on the left side
The first niche has shotgun shells inside the second beetles
At the next intersection turn left west
Continue past another block that lowers and raises as you pass The next intersection has torches mounted on the walls
Turn right north here
Continue through one more lowering and raising block to return to the gate where you entered the maze
Go through the gate which opened when you took the EASTERN SHAFT KEY and climb the ladder back to the desert SCALING THE GREAT PYRAMID AGAIN NOTE This sequence is illustrated in the series of screenshots at http tombraiders net stella TR walk khufu html
Exit the pyramid and head to the right toward the excavation pit
Take a running jump across the pit to the east side
You're aiming for the square ledge on the other side a little to the left
Turn left north and take a running jump to the next ledge
Take a standing jump up to the next flat block where you'll need to kill a giant beetle Climb up two tiers on the side of the pyramid
Then take a diagonal standing jump to the next flat spot above and to the left
Take another diagonal standing jump to the next flat ledge above and to the left
Wait for the falling blocks to come down before walking to the left side of this ledge
From there take another diagonal standing jump to the next flat square above and to the left
Kill the giant beetles that fly out of the doorway Climb to the doorway and use the GUARD'S KEYS which should still be in your inventory from previous levels to open the door
Enter the pyramid to finish the level IMPORTANT NOTE Do not leave this level without the EASTERN SHAFT KEY
Since taking it opens the exit from the maze this shouldn't be a problem unless you miss the maze area altogether or use the level skip cheat
You will need this key along with the three others you should have collected in previous levels when you get to the level INSIDE THE GREAT PYRAMID
If you accidentally bypassed the MAZE follow the directions with screenshots at http tombraiders net stella TR walk khufu html to get back there from the entrance to the Great Pyramid LEVEL INSIDE THE GREAT PYRAMID Secrets MAIN TUNNEL WITH HAND RAILS AND PITS Follow the tunnel down to the first deep pit
To get across take a diagonal running jump from the right side to the left where the ledges protrude farther
Despite all the conniptions you had to go through to get here Von Croy's henchmen have arrived first
Kill the blue robed bad guy and his comrade in red and black who comes down from the passage to the right
Enter the side tunnel where the assassin came from kill another blue robe waiting there then continue up the ramp to a gate
NOTE Poison arrows work quite well on the assassins
They seem to get past the whirling knives quite easily
I'd recommend using them if you've got any left
The tunnel beyond seems to have collapsed leaving ramps on two sides
There's another assassin along with a pesky bat or two at the top of the ramps
Kill both and advance cautiously along the lower hall between the ramps
A little way in you'll activate sliding block traps
To get through position Lara at either side of the sliding block rather than in the center about one walking step back from the block and squarely facing the other side of the opening
Take a standing jump just as the block slides away toward the other side of the opening
Repeat this for the second block ROOM WITH MARBLE BASIN Enter this room and kill the wild dogs lurking inside
Go around to the back of the basin to get inside it
Pick up the small med pack and WOODEN TORCH
Use the torch to light each of the four unlit torches on the wall
This opens the alcove on the west side of the room Pick up wideshot shells in the alcove and use the switch there to open a door elsewhere
Doing this also lets more dogs into the room
Kill them then return past the sliding blocks to the tunnel with the two ramps
You may meet another bat here if you didn't kill two of them earlier
Go to the top of the ramps where you'll find the gate you just opened
Enter the blue room Cut scene A panoramic view of the room with its four skylights and four star shaped receptacles ACTIVATING THE SHAFT OF LIGHT Place each of the SHAFT KEYS in its proper receptacle activating four beams of blue light
When you place the last key the beam of light blows a hole in the floor
NOTE If you are missing the EASTERN SHAFT KEY you can go back to the previous level now to get it
See the note on MISSING SHAFT KEYS at the end of the walkthrough for this level
Use the switch on the wall between two of the receptacles to open a gate down in the passage below letting in of Von Croy's minions
If you wait for them to come to you you can kill both with a single grenade as they enter
One drops a box of shotgun shells Return down the ramp then through the hallway between the ramps past the sliding blocks to the ROOM WITH THE MARBLE BASIN
Now the east right alcove is open
Go in and pick up a large med pack
Then use the switch to open a gate down near the SHAFT OF BLUE LIGHT Exit past the sliding blocks then through the gate and down to the MAIN TUNNEL
Here you'll encounter more blue robed baddies one on each side of the doorway as you re enter the MAIN TUNNEL
The one on the left drops a small med pack when he dies Continue downhill
Shoot a bat and pick up some Uzi clips just before the next pit
Take a standing jump across the gap
A running jump is too long and will make Lara overshoot the ledge
Kill another bat
Then take a running jump across the next pit
From here you can kill another bad guy in the hall ahead Before jumping across the next pit turn around and use the light in your BINOCULARS or a flare to see a small alcove down inside the dark pit
Take a standing jump down to this alcove and pick up a CROSSBOW or arrows if you already have the weapon
This is secret
Congratulations if you've found all the secrets
Take a standing jump from the edge of the ledge to grab the opposite rim of the pit and pull up Take a standing jump over the next pit to another narrow ledge
Hop down to the ledge just below where you'll find a large med pack
Now take a running jump across the last pit toward the gate
It should be open if you used the switch in the east alcove of the ROOM WITH THE MARBLE BASIN
Enter and kill a few more bats Climb down inside the opening with the SHAFT OF BLUE LIGHT
Partway down on the west side is an opening
Climb in and follow the passage to the next level MISSING SHAFT KEYS If you are missing the EASTERN SHAFT KEY you can return to the previous level to get it
In the room with the four skylights and four star shaped receptacles pull the switch to open the gate below and kill the robed enemies who come to investigate
Return down the ramp and through the gate you just opened to the main tunnel Go up the ramp taking a running jump grab to get across the gap
An assassin comes in through the pyramid entrance as you make your way up the ramp
Wait for him come halfway down the ramp before killing him or you may be unable to pick up the large med pack he drops
The first time I killed him he fell near the entrance so I couldn't get close enough to pick up the med pack without triggering the level load Exit to the previous level then make your way across the side of the pyramid to the left backtracking the way you came
Jump the excavation pit to the space between two of the smaller pyramids where you'll find the entrance to the MAZE
Details are shown in the series of screenshots at http tombraiders net stella TR walk khufu html
If you need help navigating the MAZE and finding the EASTERN SHAFT KEY follow the KHUFU'S QUEEN'S PYRAMIDS walkthrough
Once you have the key return to the room with the star shaped key receptacles INSIDE THE GREAT PYRAMID and continue as described under quot ACTIVATING THE SHAFT OF LIGHT quot above If you are missing any of the three other keys I'm afraid you're out of luck as it's impossible to go back to any of the earlier levels
You can either replay from an earlier save use the level skip cheat here or download a saved game for the end of this level
Links to savegame files appear in the online version of this walkthrough at http tombraiders net stella TR walk insidegreatpyr html LEVEL TEMPLE OF HORUS Secrets FIRST WATER AND SCALES PUZZLE Go up the ramp to a room with a cage containing a nasty monster
At the other end of the room is a balance beam scale with a silver pitcher on one side and a feather on the other
As you approach the scale Lara looks to the left at the inscription above one of the fountains
There are two wavy line symbols representing water so for this puzzle you need two liters of water
NOTE For info on the origins of this puzzle see the FYI note at the end of this document
Pick up the LARGE WATERSKIN from the floor near the skeleton
You will need this along with the SMALL WATERSKIN which you should still have in your inventory from the MASTABAS level to complete the puzzle
The large waterskin holds five liters the small waterskin holds three liters
You can fill the skins at the fountains empty them on the ground and combine the contents using the inventory ring in order to get the amount you need in one skin First empty the small waterskin if it still has any water in it
Stand Lara somewhere other than in one of the fountains escape to inventory select the small waterskin and use it to empty it
The large waterskin should be empty when you find it
You should now fill it Stand in either fountain select the large waterskin and use it to fill it
BUG NOTE If Lara says quot no quot when you try to fill or empty the waterskins try pressing Action instead of Enter when using or combining the items within the inventory ring
This may help
If not see the bug note at the end of this document
Now you should have the large waterskin filled with five liters and the empty small waterskin
Select the large waterskin then combine it with the small waterskin to fill the small waterskin from the large one
You should now have the small waterskin with three liters and the large waterskin with two liters Position Lara squarely facing the scale platform with the pitcher on it
Make sure she's right up against it
You might want to save your game before pouring the water
Select the large waterskin with two liters of water and use it to pour the water into the pitcher
If you're too far from the scale Lara will pour the water on the floor and you'll have to start over
You will hear water pouring if you've done it correctly
If you use two liters of water the scale will balance and the grate in the floor nearby will open
If you use the wrong amount of water the scale won't balance and the monster will be released
You must then kill it and it's rather hard to kill poison arrows work quite well though or reload a saved game and try again Drop down through the open grate and follow the passage to a room with a climbing pole going down into an opening lined with retractable spikes
Enter and kill a couple of bats
Take a standing jump to grab the pole
Slide down to just above the spikes
Then just as the spikes begin to recede slide down through the opening
Kill a few more bats in the room below
Continue to the next room SECOND WATER AND SCALES PUZZLE It's the same basic setup as the previous puzzle only this time according to the number of wavy lines above the fountains you need four liters of water
First pour out the small waterskin so both skins are empty
Now go to one of the pools and fill the large waterskin
Select the large waterskin then combine it with the small waterskin to pour water from the large skin into the small one
You should now have the small waterskin filled with three liters and the large with two liters
Empty the small waterskin
Again select the large waterskin and combine it with the small waterskin to pour water from the large skin into the small one
You should now have the small waterskin with two liters and the large waterskin empty
Refill the large waterskin
Again select the large waterskin and combine it with the small waterskin to pour water from the large skin into the small one
You should now have the small waterskin with three liters and the large waterskin with four liters Go to the scale and pour the four liters of water from the large waterskin into the pitcher
This should balance the scales opening the grate in the floor
As with the previous puzzle if you use the wrong amount of water the cage door opens releasing the Ammit like monster
You'll need to kill it or reload in order to try again Drop down through the open grate and follow the passage to another room with a climbing pole and retractable spikes
Again you'll need to kill some bats three I think
Then take a standing jump to grab the pole
Slide down to just above the spikes
Then just as the spikes begin to recede slide down through the opening
Kill more bats in the room below
Continue to the next room THIRD WATER AND SCALES PUZZLE Here we go again
This time there's only one wavy line symbol above each fountains
That means you need to pour one liter of water into the vessel on the scale
Fill the small waterskin
Select the small waterskin then combine it with the large one
You should now have the large waterskin with three liters and the small waterskin empty
Fill the small skin again
Select it and combine it with the large one
You should now have the large waterskin with five liters and the small one with one liter Go to the scale and pour the one liter of water from the small waterskin into the pitcher
This should balance the scales opening the grate in the floor
Again if you use the wrong amount of water the cage door opens releasing a monster
You'll need to kill it or reload in order to try again
Once you get the grate open drop down through the opening and follow the passage ROOM WITH SHAFT OF BLUE LIGHT Climb down inside the shaft
There's a small room partway down the shaft
This contains a complicated trapdoor mechanism and a closed gate
There's nothing you can do here now so climb all the way down the shaft until you can dismount on a small ledge Cut scene A panoramic view of the statue of Horus awaiting its armor
It stands in a cave on a small island surrounded by a moat
Classic boss level architecture if you ask me
SHOWDOWN Turn right north and take a running jump from the ledge to land in the water below
Turn around and find a place where you can climb out of the water onto the island a little bit to the left of where you splashed down
Place each of the HOLY SCRIPTURES on one of the pedestals surrounding the statue of Horus
You should have these from the UNDERNEATH THE SPHINX level
Then approach the statue from the front
BUG NOTE There is a bug in this section which may manifest in varying degrees
Details are given in the bug note at the end of this document
Cut scene Lara arranges the armor on the statue and places the amulet on its chest FMV sequence High in the heavens sparkling light energy coalesces into a shining falcon which dives down through space into the pyramid
It smashes into the statue energizing the god and bringing him into physical form Then somewhere outside a swarm of locusts gathers and speeds toward the pyramid
The insects penetrate the tunnels and surround Horus
The god explodes his energy scattered
Lara is blown off her feet by the blast and the amulet flies through the air landing in the water nearby
Set appears in Horus's place Set My wicked cousin is once again returned to the stars
It is I who shall rule over this world once more
Come forth and kneel and bow before your god before he extinguishes your worthless life Set is apparently unwilling to negotiate
He immediately starts shooting shards of some weird blue energy
You can't destroy him
After all he is a god
So you'll have to re entomb him
First find the AMULET OF HORUS which was flung into the water when Horus was vanquished
It is on the bottom of the moat just below the ledge where you climbed out of the water earlier and nearly on a direct line from Lara's starting position after the movie
Just turn left north and run to the water jump in and pick up the artifact Once you have the amulet the wrought iron gate on the south side of the cave opens
To get there turn left and swim around the island to the southwest corner of the cave
Here you can climb out of the water on a small square ledge
Take a standing jump up the slope
Then follow the rock shelf around to the left south and up the ramp to the open gate
Enter pick up the Uzi clips behind the gate and pull the switch to open the other gate on the north side of the cave To get there exit the first switch room and go to the right east
Take a running jump from the end of the rock ledge to land on the rocks below in the southeast corner
Cross the rocks to the far left northeast side and turn to face north
The cave wall should now be on Lara's right
Take a running jump to grab the thin ledge ahead
Pull up
Take a running jump from that ledge to grab the block ledge ahead and pull up
Lara should still be facing north with the east wall on her right
Take a standing jump up the slope and follow the rock shelf around to the left northwest
Jump down from the high ledge to the ledge running along the north wall this has a rectangular mural with bird wings above it
Enter the room pick up the small med pack behind the gate and pull the switch
This activates a mechanism up in the room inside the SHAFT OF BLUE LIGHT Exit the north switch room and jump into the water
You'll land in the moat just about where you picked up the amulet
Swim to the right all the way back around to the southwest corner
Climb out on the same small square ledge
Now repeat the same sequence you did to get to the two gates originally working your way around from the southwest corner to the northeast corner
This time you don't need to use the switch in the south room
Just run across the ledge and jump off the other side
And when you reach the rock shelf in the northeast corner instead of jumping down to the ledge near the north gate look for a light colored square block that wasn't there before Climb on top of this block and take a standing jump to the flat spot at the top of the slope
If you need it pick up the small med pack on the left
Then take a running jump from the right south end of the ledge to grab the rectangular ledge jutting out of the left east wall
Pull up
Go to the other end of this ledge and take a running jump aiming to the left of the stalactite hanging from the ceiling
You'll land on a dark ledge in the southeast corner of the cave above where you were earlier
Cross that ledge to the far right southwest corner and look for a crawlspace ahead in the overhanging rock
Take a running jump to grab the opening and crawl in Go through the narrow tunnel and crawl out the opening on the other side
Turn or roll to face west away from the opening
Run around the corner to the right northwest end of the ledge
Lara should now be facing north
Take a running jump to grab the ledge above and pull up
Go to the right side of this ledge so you're facing the SHAFT OF BLUE LIGHT
Take a running jump to grab the climbable wall
Climb up and to the right to the ledge where you first entered the cave
Grab the climbable wall on the left and start climbing up inside the SHAFT OF BLUE LIGHT Cut scene Lara finishes climbing to the room above
She places the Amulet of Horus into the odd mechanism
The trapdoor closes presumably sealing Set inside the cave FROM THE SHAFT OF BLUE LIGHT TO THE EXIT Turn around and exit through the gate
Go up the stairs cautiously because there is a sliding block trap ahead
As with the previous traps to get through position Lara at either side of the sliding block and take a standing jump just as the block slides away toward the other side of the opening
Repeat this for two more block traps At the top of the stairs is a steep tunnel
The vibrations from Set's almighty tantrum have begun to knock the place down
Wait in the doorway as a couple of huge stone blocks fall from the ceiling
Then continue up the right side of the tunnel
If you look up you'll notice that the falling blocks are the ones with skulls on them
You can then avoid standing under them
Take a running jump across the deep pit to grab the opposite edge
Pull up and go between the two columns and up the left side of the slope in order to avoid more falling blocks
Take another running jump across the next pit to grab either the left side or the middle of the opposite ledge
If you grab the left side traverse to the middle
Pull up For this next section of tunnel avoid the left side where there are more falling blocks
Take a running jump from the right side to grab the ledge on the other side of the third pit
Pull up and run into the hall in the center before the various falling blocks slam down
Now continue up the ramp to finish the level and the game MENKAURE'S PYRAMID BUG NOTE To avoid and or remedy the bug in the BUILDING WITH GUARD UNDER SIEGE see above try these The bug is apparently triggered by using the shotgun to kill the scorpion
Avoid this by using another weapon Another player found that holding the draw weapons key down while the cut scene played also prevented the bug from being triggered If the bug is already activated and Lara will not draw weapons try selecting the crossbow from the inventory screen
Then select a flare from the inventory screen
When you return to play Lara should draw the crossbow and after that she should function normally Or select the binoculars from the inventory screen
Lara should be able to do this as usual
Then when you put them away she should function normally
This method was suggested by a PlayStation user
I'm not sure if it works on the PC
Special thanks to the players who posted these on the tombraiders com forum TEMPLE OF HORUS BUG NOTE This particular bug can range from mildly annoying to crippling
It apparently begins in the third water puzzle area
At this point you may notice flares don't work
You can draw them but they don't light until you throw them
Also Lara may refuse to use the waterskins
Later in the area with the statue of Horus she may refuse to put the holy scriptures on the pedestals
And for some players the Amulet of Horus remains in the inventory after the cut scene and movie and does not appear on the bottom of the moat
As a result it could not be picked up the south gate doesn't open and the level can't be completed
Possible fixes include the following If you're playing on the PC try pressing Action instead of Enter when using or combining items in the inventory If you're having trouble placing the holy scriptures or using the waterskins and the above suggestion doesn't work just keep trying
Some players have reported that Lara will eventually do what she's supposed to do If the amulet doesn't leave your inventory and appear on the bottom of the moat try lighting a flare underwater
Some players have reported that doing this causes the amulet to appear
And from what I've heard so far if you are able to retrieve the amulet everything returns to normal If none of these work PC players can download savegames to complete the level

Lara out of breath and limping makes her way toward the exit as the tomb crumbles
A shadow passes across the sunlit doorway
Lara looks up and sees that it is Von Croy
He motions for her to come along Von Croy Quickly girl before it collapses around you She is knocked back as a tremor rocks the tomb Lara You back Werner

FYI TEMPLE OF HORUS SCALE PUZZLES This puzzle is an allusion to the ancient Egyptians' beliefs about death and the afterlife described in their Book of the Dead
In order to attain immortality a soul had to endure a series of trials culminating in the weighing of the heart which the Egyptians believed was the seat of the soul against the quot feather of truth quot If the person had been good and just in life the heart and the feather would balance and the person would be granted immortality
If the heart was heavy with misdeeds then the gods would refuse the person salvation and his or her heart would be eaten by the monster goddess Ammit also known as quot the devourer quot
Ammit is described as having the head of a crocodile the forequarters of a lion and the hindquarters of a hippopotamus

Tomb of Seth Welcome to the Tomb of Seth where we will kick off this epic adventure
We'll be getting acquainted with Aziz your friendly guide who starts off the level by lighting the first of many torches
After he lights his torch he will move down the passage lighting other torches along the wall
There are plenty of dark areas ahead and Aziz won't always be with you
The first thing you need to do is grab the flares to your left and some more flares behind you
Continue down the passage then get the shotgun in the first shallow pit
Another shallow pit ahead contains a large medkit and a scorpion
Kill the scorpion with your pistols then take the medkit
Go up the ramp on your left then get shotgun shells
Go down and turn around
Take out your shotgun then move toward the blue mist until the camera shifts and comes rushing at you
When you are back in control a dog will be attacking
Eliminate him then jump across a deep pit you just passed to you right then get between the two ledges along the right wall
Climb onto the left ledge to get a small medkit
Now return to the main path leading to the tomb then get the large medkit on the ramp
In the right corner is a small medkit in blue mist
Light a flare then go get it
Enter the tomb then follow Aziz down the hall and into the next room
Two scorpions attack when Aziz lowers a wall kill them with your pistols
Light a flare then get two boxes of flares in the dark corners of the room
Head down the sloped passage then follow it until you arrive at a sandpit
Climb down into the pit then get shotgun shells from the short tunnel
Kill two scorpions with your pistols
Get the small medkit on the platform as you climb out then return to the upper room where Aziz awaits
The door near him is locked so move to the door and activate the switch inside the hole in the wall
Get a large medkit behind you in another hole in the wall
The pit where you just came from begins to fill with sand
Head down into the room that is now filled with sand then cross over to the pedestal with the Eyepiece
Take the Eyepiece to open the door back in the previous room and grab the medkit from the other pedestal before returning to the now open door
Aziz will enter then you can follow
Enter the next room then follow Aziz around the large central altar and down some stairs
Let Aziz go ahead of you to disable a deadly blade trap after all that's what you're paying him for
Get the second Eyepiece from the pedestal then combine the two pieces of the eye in your inventory to complete the Eye of Horus
Return to the room with the central altar then climb up and jump to grab the rope
Spin around so you are facing the door with the blue glow
Start swinging then launch yourself into the doorway and enter
This large circular room has a giant spike roller that circle around every few seconds
You are going to need to keep an eye on this device as you perform the next series of moves
Turn right then pull up to the ledge
Run forward then jump to the alcove to the right
Climb up then get the small medkit
Climb the high ledge on your left then quickly roll and turn right
Do a running jump and grab then pull up to the flat ledge on the other side
You are safe here the spikes cannot reach you
Climb up to the top where you can get some flares to the left
Stay along this wall then walk forward and drop onto the next flat ledge
Ahead of you is a lit passage
Do a running jump to land inside that passage and take out your shotgun as you are about to be attacked by three jackals
Kill them then move down the passage over the grate and continue to the end
Do a safety drop down to the next area then avoid the pit with the scorpions and get the uzi gun
Continue dropping and sliding down until you reach the sandpit room
Now that you know where you are return to the altar room and go right
Insert the Eye of Horus then the door will open and two jackals will rush into the room
Kill them with your shotgun
When they are dead move into the area where they came from then continue until you reach the Sphinx head
Aziz continues ahead but there are some items for you to collect
Some uzi clips is between the stairs on the right and on the left is a small medkit
Get them
Now you can go after Aziz and go through the door and into the next room
Aziz sets the water on fire and a door will open
Follow him down the steps
He will go left at the intersection but you need to turn right and head toward the green area to retrieve a small medkit at the bottom of a small pit
Continue forward into the green room then note the gate on the left preventing Aziz from joining you
Head through the open door on the right then follow the passage until you reach a room with cool designs in the floor and a hanging chain
Give the chain a quick pull to open the gate then Aziz will soon arrive with his useful torch
First go down a sloped path you just passed then get a shotgun at the end
Pull the chain then go up the other path back to the cool design room
Your next objective will be clear when you notice certain floor panels being lit by the light
Do standing jumps from each square to guarantee a save landing
You need to land on each lit tile to trigger the gate
If you mess up load the game
When you successfully cross over and the gate opens you can get the Timeless Sands and proceed through the next gate to return to the Sphinx
Go to the left at the burning torch
Go down the ramp on the right then go pass the doorway on your left

He runs off in panic leaving you to finish the mission all by yourself
Continue through the new passage then kill three scorpions with your pistols
Drop into the next room
Move to the center then get the shotgun shells
Head toward the statue then climb up to it and put the Timeless Sands in its hands
This causes sand to rush into the room while emptying the other room with the Sphinx
Quickly exit this room while avoiding the sand
Dodge the scorpion then return to the room with the Sphinx
With the sand drained into the other room you can now enter the mouth of the Sphinx
Jump to the mouth and hang then pull up and crouch to enter
Once inside you can move forward until you slide into the next level
Burial Chambers While you are sliding down the first ramp jump to the hole in the ceiling and grab the edge
Pull up to get a large medkit
Finish sliding into the next room then push the lever to open the gate behind you
Run through then slide into the next room
In this room is a timed spike trap so act fast
Take the Hand of Orion then jump to the left to get shotgun shells
Getting this causes the gate to open so run forward past the statues and into the next room
More spikes
Walk up to the spikes then wait for them to retract then run forward before they reset
Continue down the passage to the right then shoot the urn on the left with your pistols revealing a small medkit
Take it
Continue to the next room until you reach some more spikes
Walk to the edge then run past them when they are retracted
Slide into the next room where you will find a place on the wall to insert the Hand of Orion
Doing so will retract the spikes but now the blades are spinning
Walk to the edge then do a standing jump as the blade pass by
Now quickly do a sideways jump to the left as the next blade comes to you
You should now be standing on a column with a shotgun but the blades are still spinning
Jump straight up to avoid the blade then get the shotgun before backflipping to the floor below
Get the small medkit on your left then climb up to the main entrance behind you
Do a running jump from the edge then you should land almost on top of the shells
Take the ammo
You now need to make your way to the left corner where the exit is
Back of the ledge then shimmy around to the other side
Pull up when the blade pass by then quickly backflip into the exit
Continue up to the next passage
Climb over a block in the passage then you will soon arrive at a room with a sarcophagus and a cut scene
Do not approach it
Instead turn left and light a flare
Get the small medkit from the corner and shotgun shells from the other corner behind you to the left
Exit through the new doorway
Continue down and to the left then enter the next room with more coffins on three walls and a central statue
Get the small medkit along the left wall then drop into the lower area in front
A small medkit and shotgun shells are stashed down here
Get these items then return to the previous room with the sarcophagus that you avoided earlier
Approach the steps near coffin then a cut scene will take over
Follow the blood back to the previous room where the three coffins are now open
The mummies won't be interested in you as long as you keep your distance
Move toward the statue and push it now push it two times to the left toward the circle pattern on the floor
When the statue is in the proper location a door will open inside the sarcophagus behind you
Approach the coffin and lure the mummy out
Run around him and into the passage beyond

Climb up onto another block then go into the room with the lever and push it to open the gate below
Carefully make your way back to the bottom and enter the gate
Push the lever inside to rotate the chamber
Turn around then make your way into the hole in the right wall
Head left down the hall then slide to the ground below
Head toward the hole then safely drop to the room below where you can find the Hand of Sirius
Leave through the only exit then follow it to the wall that you can climb taking you to a block that you must also climb to get out
Climb the next block then move to the edge and jump and hang
Climb onto the block then crawl under some spikes as you head left to the end
Save your game because your next jump is fatal if you miss
Jump and lean to the right to fall on the ledge below
Now you can climb to the bottom and enter a room with two mummies
Pull the chain to spin the room and wake up the mummies
Dodge them then climb the wall in front
As you reach the top do a backflip to land safely on the floor of the main chamber
Head toward the two blocks on the left then climb them to insert the Hand of Sirius
This lowers a rope in the room
Turn around then walk towards the rope to the left and jump to grab it
Swing across to the other opening and enter
Get the Scarab Talisman from the pedestal then ready your shotgun
Two dogs attack as you go down the passage and a third dog waits further down the hall
Kill them in first mode
Continue then you will return to the cavern
Turn right then take the stairs in front
When you reach the intersection continue straight and climb the wall
When you reach the top take out your pistols then blast the two urns to get a small medkit and shotgun shells
Climb into the next chamber with two mummies and a Golden Serpent
Take the serpent and the mummies will come to life
Dodge them as you make your escape to the right
Continue forward then slide into the next area
Watch for the spikes falling from above
Turn left then sprint to the far left corner where you can be safe
Climb out then continue down the passage until you reach a large deep hole
Get a large medkit
You will probably take some damage even doing a safety drop so make sure you are at full health before lowering yourself over the edge and dropping down
You are back in the large cavern again
Go to the temple then climb the block and enter the room with the sand and the mummy
Here are two sockets which are just perfect for the two items you have in your inventory
Put the Golden Serpent in the right socket and the Scarab Talisman in the left
The room starts to fill with sand and the mummy wakes up
You are stuck down here with the mummy until the sand has filled up enough to let you climb out
Dodge the mummy until you can escape through the exit in the corner
Go through the doorway then exit this level
Valley of the Kings Seems that Aziz isn't a very nice guy but you are just in time to be attacked by his seven henchmen
Make a note of the items they drop while you kill them with your shotgun in first mode
When they are all dead you can collect quite an assortment of medkits and ammo and also the jeep keys which you need to chase Aziz
Before hopping into the jeep head over toward the dark corner near the left of the jeep and light a flare
Climb up then you will find an area with a shotgun and two boxes of shotgun shells
Take them and leave
Now head over to the other corner in front then climb some rocks to the right
Here you will find two boxes of shotgun shells uzi clips and a small medkit
Take them
Get in the jeep then use the keys to start it up

If there is water on the floor when you first entered the savegame bug has been activated and you'll need to load up a previous save and try again Run off the right corner to the pink crate below then pick up some more ammo for your HK
Note More ammo will appear if you run out While standing on the crate turn around then target the red valve in sniper mode with your laser sight equipped
Shoot the valve to burst the pipe and flood the room
You should see water coming out of the pipe and the floor will now be covered with water
Do a standing jump back to the duct then move away from the opening
Position yourself near the edge of the duct then shoot in burst mode with your laser sight equipped
If the Cyborg shoots at you hop away from the opening then walk forward again and keep shooting each time he walks past
This requires a great deal of patience but it helps to save your health allot and allot of ammo
If the Cyborg doesn't show drop down to the crate then jump back to the duct to lure him out
As the Cyborg takes damage his robotic skeleton will start to show
When he starts to burst with blue electricity he's nearing death
A few more shots then he'll short out and collapse
Once the Cyborg is destroyed you can save your game in another slot
Do not hop down into the water or you will die
Instead drop to the crate then carefully line up a running jump to the sloped duct
Keep in the jump key until you land on the top duct
Drop to the black metal grate just to the right then pick up another Grappling hook
Equip the Grappling Gun then shoot in laser sight mode to the grate in the ceiling

Take one hop back then do a standing jump to grab the rope
Swing to the open grate at the top of the room then grab the edge and pull up
Go to the back of the alcove then use the switch to drain the room below
Bug Note Do not save your game again after using the switch
If you reload the room will be flooded and you won't be able to get the Key Do a running jump from the opening past the dangling rope to the top of the duct then get some more Grappling ammo on the black grate
Safely drop to the floor then pick up the large medkit and the Key Bit near the Cyborg
Pulling the switch to drain the room also closed the vent over the duct
Climb and swing back up to the alcove then pull the switch to re flood the room and re open the duct
Again do a running jump from the opening to the top of the duct
Hang from the edge then let go and grab again to grab the bottom edge
Pull up then follow the duct and crawlspace to the doorway in front

Bug Note There is another potential bug in the next section
Avoid saving your game between the beginning of the first run past the helicopter and when you trap the second Cyborg As soon as you enter the hallway a helicopter lets loose a storm of machine gun fire
This makes the yellow tanks explode while blowing away large sections of floor and hurting you if you are nearby
Don't worry if you don't see any tanks
To get to the other side of the building run past the helicopter
Jump the pits as you go but stay in the middle to avoid the overhanging beams on the right
When you rsquo re in the little corner lounge catch your breath for a while

This passage leads into a room with poison gas

Don't wait around to fight him just run past him to the next room and go through the door on the right

Traitors Gate Personal Observations and Walkthrough By Soren Andersen These observations that precede the walkthrough may be read before beginning to play this game as they will provide helpful insights to gameplay without in any way being spoilers or at least not very much
Traitors Gate is a very good game with excellent graphics and action puzzles
That being said there are several characteristics where it falls short particularly in comparison with other Adventure games www dreamcatchergames com support This FAQ list has additional information that could well be relevant
PIAD provides a lot of knapsack items that appear in the right hand inventory after you locate it and you garner an even greater number of other items in the left hand one
Many of the latter have no function in the game a legitimate Adventure game ploy but in both cases there is much searching to find a wanted item
With one exception once an item is in inventory it is there forever
It would be useful if the knapsack items were identified when the cursor is placed on them a helpful feature is the PDA equipment icon the wrench which identifies and elaborates on the individual knapsack items
A couple of maps diagrams of the Tower of London complex have been included to help you follow Raven's movements as he travels about
One of these is an annotated copy of the one that appears in the GPS function of the PDA
Correlate these with the sewer map
An interesting virtual tour that might be helpful may be found on the Internet athttp www toweroflondontour com Following are some things to keep in mind as you begin and while you are playing the game some of which are obvious some not and others covered in the game booklet but bear repeating WALKTHROUGH Introduction Traitors Gate is a more linear game than it might appear at first though by no means completely so
There are many relevant places in the Tower of London complex to be examined but since Raven is prowling after closing time many doors are locked and guards are posted
An elaborate security system is activated and must be circumvented
For these reasons gathering the items needed to get other items to finally breach the regalia vault follows a fairly set path
Briefly from the White Tower where you start the game you must gain entry to the sewer system in order to get the equipment left there for you then begin gathering the other items and the information that you will need to get into the vault where the crown jewels are stored and in the process you must establish a getaway route since the one to the vault will not be available for leaving
As it happens much of what you will need is to be found in the Queen rsquo s House readily accessible from the sewer so that is the place to begin your exploration of the Tower complex and from which there is a reasonably easy path to the Hospital Block another source of many needed items
You must then traverse the complex making much use of the sewer and neutralizing the security system until you get the keys to the main vault where you replace the regalia and make your escape
Though not explicitly stated in the briefing Raven must have been told that Tower security is centered in the upper floor of the Devereaux Tower and that the security chief rsquo s office is in the basement of the Hospital Block
He must know about the two sets of video junction boxes or he would not have been supplied with the scart adapter and the Digital Loop Units
If he was not given a sewer map it was an oversight
The first thing to do after you set up the PDA is to take the time to read the information supplied by clicking on the upper left icon
This perusal might seem to be time consuming but it is well worth it presenting descriptions and historical facts about the crown jewels and the Tower of London as well as a review of the mission brief in particular the data on the crown jewels gives information on which of them are targeted their specific location and clues to opening their vault locks
After you have read it you can restart the game and the time used in reading it will not be charged against the time allocated to complete the game
White Tower Basement When the game begins the PDA clock tells you it is hours and as instructed in the briefing you have remained in the White Tower after closing time where you have been concealed in a closet since hours reading the above mentioned PDA data
Use the PDA GPS function adjust the magnification to indicate your location
You have only three things with you a multitool a lock decoder card and a packet of gum
You must get to the items left for you in the sewer by a Navy SEAL team
Look around the closet and find a box on a shelf next to you from which you may take the flashlight and the spray can of WD lubricant you do not need the torch igniter
Leave the closet and go to the area beyond the construction display board where from the yellow toolbox you must take the bolt cutter but the unneeded hammer will just clutter up your inventory
Return to the closet door and proceed through the one next to it
Around the corner inside a guard rail unlatch the gate you will find a locked metal grate in the floor
Drag the bolt cutter into the action screen to remove the grate padlock and a cut scene shows Raven climbing down to the well at the bottom of the shaft
The bolt cutter will fall but you don rsquo t need it any more
Drag the flashlight from your left inventory into the screen to provide illumination then enter the water
Another cut scene takes Raven through an underwater passage to emerge into the sewer system under the tower complex
The GPA does not function in the underground sewer nor does the pullout compass
Sewer Use the accompanying sewer diagram to navigate from the White Tower sewer entrance to the locked gate at the bottom of the diagram
Get a closeup of the rectangular green box at the left top of the gate then drag the multitool into the screen
Open the bottom screwdriver and click on the check mark at top right
The tool will remove the holding screw and the lid will fly open
Drag the gum up to the open box and a piece will go between the electrical contacts to prevent closure and sending an alarm when the gate opens
Back off from the closeup and turn to the control box on the wall to the left
Click on the green button to raise the gate
Pass through the gate and find the knapsack of equipment in a niche in the wall to the right
This equipment will place many items in the right inventory and you should now refer to the game booklet to identify them and find out about their functions or use the equipment icon in the PDA or both
The most direct route to the Queen rsquo s House is via the grating indicated near the left edge of the sewer map
When you move through the sewer to this grating click on it and you will climb through
Look up to see two windows in the wall above one with a balcony
Maneuver your view to get the balcony as close to the center of the screen as you can then drag the folded crossbow from the right inventory into the action screen where it will unfold and cock
Drag the grapple into the screen and it will load onto the crossbow
Click on the checkmark at the upper right screen corner and you will be able to shoot the crossbow to just above the balcony
If your aim is good there will ensue a video of Raven shooting the crossbow and the grapple hooking on the balcony railing
Drag the rope lift unit into the screen and another video takes Raven up the rope and through the window into the Queen rsquo s House
Queen rsquo s House Most of your investigation here will be upstairs which is accessed through the door in the opposite wall but before you go there get the flat key used as a bookmark in the heraldic book on the table in front of you
Now go through the door and go up the stairs
Do not go down as there is a guard below
At the top of the stairs you will be facing the door on the left
Enter the room and go straight ahead to the table at the wall opposite
From the right hand drawer take the card with the Chinese characters paired with Arabic numerals
The items in the left hand drawer are not needed
Leave the room and get a closeup of the code lock on the side of the other door
From your right inventory get the green decoder card and insert it in the slot at the bottom of the code lock then on the PDA select the icon showing the numerals and the lock decoding will start
When the digit code shows click these numerals on the code lock keypad whereupon the decoder card will withdraw and you can open the door
Note Enter the room and move to the window then turn right and approach the table
Lift the table top and from the items inside take only the bronze key and the yellow cylinder
Back off turn right move ahead once and turn left to face the large display of five ovals mounted on the wall
Below this display is a smaller one showing a heraldic shield and three gold rosettes
Press the rosettes left right center you will hear a click
Move to the right you will see a small lever protruding from the left side of the dashing portrait of the infamous Guy Fawkes
Click on this lever and the portrait swings aside to reveal a safe with a panel of three gold knobs
Turn each of the knobs so the pointers are at the o rsquo clock position and you can then use the bronze key that you just got to open the safe
Take everything from the safe but the gun and the gin bottle
Red handled key keys from the middle shelf is a duplicate Computer floppy disk Card with two unidentified door lock codes Go into the next room known as Anne Boleyn rsquo s bedroom and approach the portrait on the far wall above the table lamp on which there is an unreadable legend
Take a picture of it and let ORPHIA read it for you
Note ORPHIA will reply with the date shown on the portrait European fashion d m y which they think is supposed to be Anne rsquo s execution date but is in error but that is immaterial because the portrait date rsquo s digits that they show are a code that you need
Now turn your attention to the trunk in the corner of the room
One of the keys in inventory will open it and within you will find an ornate quot Chinese Box quot
Click on this box to bring it up to the edge of the trunk
On it you will see six code wheels with Chinese characters that must be set but first you must unlock the wheels by applying the flat bookmark key that you got downstairs
The code is the Anne Boleyn portrait date digits and of course you turn the wheels using the card from the other room to match the Chinese characters with the date numerals
When the box opens lift the flap on the bottom and get another card with a code number listed this one identified as being for the main vault doors and also a very important white security card displaying a crest and a blue rectangle
Leave the blue PIN code generator you can find another one later
Raven has now acquired all the items needed in his quest that are available here in the Queen rsquo s House
Return downstairs to the room that you entered
At this point you have the option of exploring the Queen rsquo s Tower
For this you must click on the tall clock in the corner of the room which will swing aside to reveal a passage to this tower
At the end of the passage is a tower room that you should ignore as there is nothing in it for the game
Take the steps to the upper tower room where next to the table you will find a floorboard darker than the rest
Click on this board and it will move aside and from the cavity beneath you may acquire a rough sketch that has little relevance and which you really do not need
Return back down to the entrance room
It may also be noted that upon leaving the knapsack location in the sewer you could take the moat exit travel around the outer tower wall past the Traitors Gate to the Byward Tower enter and go to the top floor from which using the crossbow and grapple through a window you could get to the Queen rsquo s Tower and enter right next to the dark floorboard then go down the stairs to the room entered as described previously
Along about this time you will probably begin receiving a series of periodical e mail messages from ORPHIA containing data fragments recovered from the hard disks that Major Anderson tried to destroy but in which effort he was only partially successful
They are not particularly helpful
Leave the Queen rsquo s House entry room through the door opposite the clock and go out the window at the end of the hall to Raleigh rsquo s Walk
Unlatch the gate and read as much of the sign as you can noting the years of Raleigh rsquo s birth and death for future reference a ready alternative is to go to the end of the Walk then turn come back to where you can take a picture of the sign and let ORPHIA read it for you
You must proceed to the end of the Walk where a locked door in the Wakefield Tower forces you grapple to St Thomas Tower if you try this however there is a guard below to the left N who will discover you and take you out so you must take him out first
Get out your crossbow drag the box of tranquilizing ice darts onto the screen and click on one to load it in the crossbow
Click on the checkmark then when the guard is motionless next to his guardhouse on the right end of his short patrol path carefully shoot him in the neck
With the guard spread eagled unconscious on the ground you can now go the end of the Walk and shoot the grapple into the open window in the St Thomas Tower opposite
A video shows Raven making the shot and crossing on the rope behind the back of an oblivious guard
St Thomas Tower There are a couple of rooms here containing exhibits for you to examine and photograph if you wish informative but nothing to advance the game
Go down the short hallway to the left of your entrance window to another room in which is to be found a very large chest that holds some historical documents also informative but not game advancing
Leave by going up the circular stairway
Go through the door at the top and along the passageway which takes you across a bridge to the Wakefield Tower throne room
Wakefield Tower Across the room in a wall recess to the left of the fireplace you will see a wooden chest go to it and apply the picklock from your right inventory to the trunk rsquo s keyhole
Move the picklock around vigorously it may take a little time but the trunk will eventually open
On the inside trunk lid is a small tapestry click on one of the corner fasteners and it will fall forward to reveal an ancient document written in Latin
Click on this document to bring it center screen photograph it to get a translation from ORPHIA then put it in your inventory
Click on the tapestry to raise it back up to the trunk lid then from the bottom of the chest get the pull ring that is the only thing in there
Warm yourself by the convenient fire until you get a reply from ORPHIA concerning this important document which tells about a secret tunnel between the Wakefield and Devereaux Towers
You can drag it from inventory onto the screen and examine it while waiting
This clearly is something to investigate
Leave the throne room by the door to the left of the one you used to enter and since tunnels are below ground go through the gate and down the stairs
Open the unarmed door and go into what must have been the tower dungeon to judge from the implements hanging on the walls
The square plate in the floor leads to the sewer but that is not a secret
Closely look at the course of wall blocks just above the floor one of them has a short peg protruding
Drag the ring that you just found in the throne room trunk to this peg the block will be removed and you will be thrust into the secret tunnel
Get out the flashlight and proceed down the steps and through the tunnel
A short way along you will find an alcove in which there is a wall niche containing a couple unimportant documents for ORPHIA to peruse should you so choose
Continue along the tunnel and up the stairs at the end
Push open the squat door blocking the exit and enter the ground floor of the Devereaux Tower
Devereaux Tower Ahead is a door leading to a courtyard and around the corner opposite this door is a storeroom containing nothing relevant to the game
In the grass of the courtyard is the Devereaux sewer exit and down some steps and across another courtyard is a door to the Waterloo Barracks gift and souvenir shop but Raven has no use for either
At one side of the shop are the formidable doors to the regalia exhibit area and you have the combination on the card from the Chinese box but this is not the time to use it
There is a good chance you could box yourself in since you have not yet prepared the way for your escape
Back in the Devereaux Tower you will find that the door from the secret tunnel has closed and there is no way to open it in fact it is impossible to find it
There are stairs going up but they lead to Tower Security Operations and are well guarded so you dare not go there
Beyond these steps is a door giving on to some passages that will take you along the inner wall to the Beauchamp Tower let rsquo s go that way
Beauchamp Tower As soon as you open the gate and enter the Beauchamp tower you are confronted by some words and symbols carved in the stone wall undated and much of it hard to read
Ancient graffiti done by a prisoner of yore perhaps
Send a picture of it to ORPHIA to see what they make of it
Around the wall are pictures with plaques that can rsquo t be read and in the center of the room is an unidentified exhibit
The short passage by the door leads nowhere the only way out is through the door and when you leave you can see two people a short distance away at the top of some stairs one of whom is a guard
Fortunately the square trapdoor of the Beauchamp sewer exit is on the left so quickly enter the sewer
This secret tunnel excursion seems to have been something of a bummer and the best thing to do is use the sewer to return to the Wakefield Tower and from there continue along the inner wall toward the Hospital Block
Wakefield Tower You emerge from the sewer in the Wakefield Tower dungeon
Go back up the circular stairs through the gate and continue up the next set of circular stairs
Go out the door where a video shows Raven going to the Lanthorn Tower
Lanthorn Tower Here there are a number of exhibits in cases and on the walls
You may inspect them if you so desire but only one has any importance find the one on the wall titled Recreation mdash it shows an elephant mdash and photograph it for reference
Find a door more or less opposite the one you entered and leave
Another video shows Raven walking along the inner wall to the Salt Tower
Salt Tower Once more there is a number of exhibits for you to look at or not as you wish and again only one thing you must do
As soon as you go down the entry steps look to the left at the wall just to the right of the arch
There are markings on the wall and your movement arrow will take you to them
Get a closeup to see on the wall a circle inside a square and a hole in the center of the circle
All is covered with a sheet of clear plastic
Bring up the multitool and open the further screwdriver
Click on the checkmark then place the cursor on the plastic and the multitool will remove the four screws holding the sheet in place
Drag the yellow cylinder from inventory to the hole to remove the masonry cover and inside you will find an unreadable document but of course ORPHIA can do so after you send them a photograph
Put the document in inventory and all the removed stuff goes back in place
Go through the arch up the stairs out the door and along the wall to the Old Hospital Block
Old Hospital Block Inside the building move along the corridor until you come to the diorama
Mildly interesting but there is nothing to be learned from it gamewise
Turn to the door opposite and lift the bar to open it
Proceed through and as you start down the stairway you can hear the door swing shut and the bar dropping in place
This is one of the few doors that cannot be opened from both sides
Go down the long stairway to the basement
Move to the end of the corridor and note the square plate in the floor this is the Hospital Block sewer access
Go through the adjacent door and turn left where at the end of the hallway you will find a guard fast asleep
Carefully remove the keyring from her lap don rsquo t touch the radio and don rsquo t move until she settles down again
Turn about and go past the stepladder to the far door which will open since you have the keys
You pass into the Red Room where a sudden blast of raucous music from a nearby radio will probably startle you
Purportedly you can shut this off but how to do so is not evident
It soon stops and fortunately has not awakened the guard
Continue through the door on the right into the Green Room and go to the other end where there is another code locked door
You can use the green decoder card as before but if you do be prepared for a long wait for the decoding to complete
An alternative is to try the pair of codes from the card found in the Guy Fawkes safe the decoder card must be in the code lock slot
When you get this door decoded you can enter the security chief rsquo s office
Go behind the desk so that you can look over the things on it
Get a closeup of the picture of the young lad click on him and the picture slides up to divulge a PIN code of
Back off from the picture and optionally get a closeup of the rectangular note device which you can access by clicking on the green button then typing the code
You can look at memos phone numbers and appointments none of which provides either new or necessary information
Investigate the room
Pressing the space bar produces a red bullseye if you are facing the large double bookshelf and when you click on the indicated book a latch is to be found behind it which will move aside a section of the bookshelf and let you into the secret room where the chief has his safe
Now you have to open the safe and PIAD has provided the tools to do it
Get a closeup of the safe and you will see that the dial is at the zero position of if at any time you want to rezero the dial click on the safe handle
The code is digits from zero turn the dial ccw to the first digit cw directly to the second digit and ccw to the third
Drag the audio sensor from the right inventory to the safe where the suction cup will hold it to the door
Select the PDA audio icon bottom left and a set of axes will appear
Move the dial unit ccw and a fairly smooth segmented one cycle curve will show on the axes
Move the dial another unit and the curve may shift a bit but still be smooth
Keep stepping the dial until the curve is no longer smooth but is ragged which indicates the first digit
Now step the dial cw until the ragged curve again appears
You have found the second code digit
Finally step the dial ccw for the third ragged curve appearance
Click on the handle and if successfully decoded the audio sensor pops off and the safe opens
Take everything from the safe but the teddy bear
superuser code cards Blue PIN code generator PIN code generator instructions T shaped key with triangular opening in the end Leave the chief rsquo s office and go to the end of the Green Room where you came in
Next to that door is another with a code lock the code being the other one on the code card you just used to get into the chief rsquo s office
After you pass this door go to cylindrical portal the end of the room noting the two electrical junction boxes on the right wall as you pass
Click on the neon arrow enter the opening click on the other neon arrow and you have found the chief rsquo s computer room
Now you have to gain access to the computer
You will encounter two other computers in this game and all three will require superuser passwords
You have three cards in inventory referring to these passwords and should have straightforward clues to them from ORPHIA replies to the pictures you have taken
In the above only the second computer is associated with a code but the number of characters in each code is different and will indicate the one to use
Get a closeup of the computer it will develop a digit code number display that is randomly generated and will be different each time the computer is accessed
Drag the PIN code generator ID NO G onto the screen
This is the PIN code generator from the chief rsquo s safe so key in his PIN code using the generator rsquo s keypad then press lt ENTER gt
Do the same for the random code that was generated by the computer
The PIN code generator will then display a digit key that you enter in the computer using the number keys of your keyboard not the number keypad then press your keyboard lt Enter gt key
The computer now asks for the superuser code in this case seven digits so it must be EXTREMA
The computer lets you have a choice of looking at the tower safety systems or at door codes
Look at the systems System for the Waterloo Barracks System for the Tower complex perimeter and System for the regalia vault
The six buttons down the left side will bring up locations for phones movement sensors heat sensors pressure sensors armed doors and cameras
The red circles indicate that System has terminals in the Hospital Block and the Devereaux Tower and System in the Waterloo Barracks
Look at the door codes the diagram for Devereaux is somewhat puzzling but at least you have three codes for when you get to that location again
Note these codes
You will recognize the diagram under Hospital as the places where you have just been and still are and you already have the codes that are shown
Back off from the computer and exit the computer room but before you leave pick up the floppy disk seen under the shelf
After passing through the revolving portal turn your attention to the two junction boxes on the wall
At this point you might wish to review what the game booklet has to say about the Digital Loop Unit DLU and the scart adapter
The former has the ability to provide up to one minute of invisibility from surveillance cameras there is an elaboration of this under the PDA equipment icon while the latter provides a tap into surveillance video circuits
Click on the left junction box the T shaped key from inventory will open the box
Drag the scart adapter from the right inventory to the left one of the row of sockets in the box and you will get a view of an exterior wall
Repeat for all but the right socket even though the adapter is in a socket drag it from the inventory to the next socket and you will get four exterior views and three blank ones
Evidently this is from System
Back off go to the right junction box and repeat the process
Here the first two and last two sockets show no pictures the third and fifth show what appear to be the storeroom that you saw in the Devereaux Tower mdash though perhaps not quite the same items so it is probably a similar room
The fourth socket shows the stairway going up from where you exited the secret Wakefield Devereaux tunnel but again it is a little different
You must at some time go here to circumvent the Tower security so put a DLU unit in the right hand socket the one with the label Link V C above it
Flip the switch on the DLU to turn it on then leave the junction box
ORPHIA will have long since sent an e mail telling you what is in the document that you found in the Salt Tower it tells of a secret room behind Henry VIII rsquo s walking stick in the Great Hall of the White Tower and how to enter using a candlestick
The document itself shows a couple of sketches one of which must be the walking stick
Here now is another intriguing thing to be investigated
There is no way out of the Hospital Block except via the sewer so make your way out past the sleeping guard who still dozes through the strident radio outburst to the sewer exit in the hall where you came into this basement
Follow the sewer to the well in the White Tower swimming through the watery passage and climbing to the white Tower basement
White Tower Go to the other room past the closet where you hid while waiting for the Tower to close and under the wooden platform that has steps going up to it the steps lead nowhere useful
You will come to a gate but since you have the key in inventory it may be opened by clicking on the latch and you can ascend the circular stone stairway
Go up two flights and at the top you will see ahead of you an archway leading to a floor of exhibits and to the right more stairs to a second exhibition floor
You can spend much time wandering around both these floors looking at the many things to be seen if you are interested in doing this and perhaps sending photographs to ORPHIA for further information save your game here and wander around as much as you wish then load the saved game and the interval spent looking will not be taken from the allotted game time
Go through the open arch and look right to see a model of the Tower of London complex then proceed one click past and turn left
Go one click along the wall and on the right is an animated display showing several stages of the White Tower construction
Continue along the wall into the next room which turns out to be a chapel
What better place to find a candlestick
Move past the book on the lectern and up to the altar where there are several candlesticks however you can't acquire any of them
Go around behind the altar where you will find one with no candle in it and this one you can put in inventory
Then turn left and proceed along the wall and out of the chapel moving ahead you will have to jog a little to the right by the end of the sword display until you come to a door in the side of a window alcove on the left
Go through this door and up yet another circular stone stairway
Use either of the doors to arrive in a large room with a green cannon prominent in the center
This is the Great Hall and on the wall at the right outlined by a black cross is Henry VIII rsquo s walking stick
A formidable item indeed
Drag the candlestick to the brass fitting on the right
It goes in the hole in the fitting spins and a portion of the wall recedes
Enter the secret room and you will be faced with a ladder
Start down the ladder which is old and rotten so the rungs break and you make a hurried descent fortunately unhurt
Drag out the flashlight
No way to go back up so head out into another tunnel this one dry unlike the sewer
A short way along on the left is a solid wall of light colored brick for you to keep in mind
Keep going through the tunnel eventually coming to another of those many circular stone stairs at the top of which is a door securely locked with an immovable rusty bolt
Here is where you can use that WD you have been carrying so long spray it on the bolt and you can pull it free and the door will swing open
Push on the wooden panel behind it and it too will swing aside and you can enter a hall with bookcases along the side
The GPS will tell you that you are in the Waterloo Barracks
Waterloo Barracks Leave this hall via the door at the end and into a room with contents that gives the impression of being a janitor rsquo s closet though it is far too large to be a closet
There are several doors but the only way out is up the stairs where there is a guard posted or to go through the door on the left wall
Here is another long hallway with many doors none of which will open except the one at the far end
On your way there you will see an elevator on the right but it is not advisable to use it right now because of the several guards on whatever floor to which it leads
Beyond the end door are a couple rooms with ropes on stanchions that are used to guide a viewing queue so it is not unreasonable to assume that this must be near the regalia exhibit in the Waterloo Barracks
You can eventually reach a locked set of solid double doors so all you can do is return to the tunnel that got you here
This too presents something of a problem since you can't go back up the broken ladder
What you are going to have to do is break through that wall of light colored brick and to do this you will have to use the limpet mine that PIAD placed in your knapsack and hope that no one is alarmed by the explosion
Drag the mine to the wall press the green button and you have seconds to back off the green arrows and hurry either way along the tunnel so you will be far enough away to be safe when the mine goes off
Assuming that you are successful you may return to view the hole that has been blown in the wall
Time is passing you rsquo d better start taking care of Tower security
Climb through the hole and into the sewer system and head for the Devereaux exit
Enter the tower
Devereaux Tower Upstairs the security operations room has its own oxygen supply as a safety precaution but this is also a point of weakness
You must get to this supply and replace the oxygen with the Isoflurane knockout gas in your knapsack and with the security personnel unconscious you can then shut down the system
Upstairs you will be under camera surveillance in the outer room and in the oxygen storage room but they are different cameras and the DLU that you enabled in the Hospital Block for this area gives you a one minute safe window for each as you move from room to room each window begins over and you can do this as often as you need to
Raven is invisible to the security camera not so to people
The PDA equipment description the wrench icon seems to imply that this function is initiated by pulling out the PDA compass and moving the double green line down to convert the compass to the DLU function but it seems to work quite well without doing that
The DLU function conversion provides a stopwatch that sounds a warning after seconds
It just keeps running you can't zero it so the only way to make effective way to use it is to wait until it is at before you go into a room if you have time
Or don rsquo t bother with it
Position the gas cylinder in inventory so you can get it without hunting and go up the stairs
At the top move toward the door that you see there it rsquo s locked turn around and go all the way into the room to the red door in back
On the way you can quickly turn and look into the control room to see a single person there
It is quite possible to perform these operations without leaving the oxygen supply room but at any time you feel that you are getting close to the window limit leave through the red door wait a moment then return and continue under a new one minute window
From the oxygen supply room move to the control room entrance where the guard is no longer visible through the window
Get a closeup of the code lock on the left
You can open this lock as you have done before using the green decoder card and associated PDA icon but again this takes much too long
Recall when you accessed the security chief rsquo s computer in the Hospital Block there was a circular diagram under Rooms Devereaux showing three codes that you noted here you are in the Devereaux Tower needing codes so try them in turn mdash with the green decoder card in the slot mdash until the doors open
It may be mentioned that here and in future similar situations the white security card with crest and blue rectangle will work as well as the green decoder card
Don the gasmask by dragging it on screen you don rsquo t want to get knocked out by your own gas
Enter the control room and go to the desk
The green notebook next to the computer mouse conceals a PIN code generator but you already have one and don rsquo t need another
Get a closeup of the computer monitor a duplicate of the one in the Hospital Block and which immediately generates a random digit code
As before drag up the PIN code generator from inventory and go through the access steps until a superuser code is requested and which is detailed on page
Look at Systems
The diagrams are the same as on the first computer except that here on the bottom right there are two keys AandDA which stand for quot Activate quot and quot Deactivate quot
Your first impulse is doubtless simply to shut everything down and go about your task but be warned that should you do so deactivating the cameras on Systems and will bring the guards
You can however deactivate all but those two and you should now do so
You can if you wish call up the Devereaux Rooms again and check the code that applies to an object at the back of the room
Look around this control room
The guard unconscious on the floor has a key that you will need so click on his belt buckle to withdraw a chain with the key on it
Go around the desk to the cabinet against the wall behind and get a closeup then use the key on the lock
When the door opens a drawer will slide out
Get another closeup and on the front edge you will see a three digit lock
Here is where you use the code for that object at the back of the room ignoring the leading zero
With the dials set to the code click on the gold bar and the grating rises so that you can get a key similar to the red handled one from the Guy Fawkes safe but here the handle is blue
The indentations in the bottom of the drawer suggest that there is yet another key to be found
To leave the control room you must again use a code lock to open the doors and here the code is the reverse of the one you used to get in
Go back downstairs where you can remove the gas mask drag it from inventory onto the screen mdash the audible breathing stops
Go out the door and to the sewer entrance in the grass of the courtyard
Enter the sewer and proceed the short distance around the corner to another set of junction boxes that are indicated on the sewer diagram
Inside these boxes they look just like the ones in the Hospital Block basement and if you plug the scart adapter in the series of sockets in the right box you will see the same views of the Devereaux security as you did before
In the left box the first four sockets bring up views in which at least one suggests that these are what the four regalia vault cameras of System see
You must go there of course so put the other DLU in the right socket and flip the switch to turn it on
Return to the Devereaux sewer exit and go down the steps to the Waterloo Barracks gift shop
Waterloo Barracks On the left wall of this shop are the doors to the regalia exhibit
In your inventory is a card found in the Chinese box of Anne Boleyn rsquo s bedroom that you can drag on screen to show the digit code for these heavy doors
Get close to the door lock click in turn on the four lights turning the dial to display the appropriate digit and then clicking on either of the spoked wheels to open the doors
Enter and turn right to pass through the exhibit area now empty of the crown jewels that are held after hours in vaults on the floor below
At the far end of this area is another pair of doors that have the same lock and the same code as the one you just used
When you go through these doors you will find yourself in the rope and stanchion queuing area that you explored earlier
Pass all the way through the rooms until you come to the elevator that you saw before
Press the green call button to open the elevator doors then go in and get a closeup of the control panel
From inventory drag one of the plain flat keys to the panel which will open a cover to show another button
Press this button to descend
Leave the elevator and go to the door on the left beyond which is a closet containing a plethora of cases and equipment
Focus on the maroon Garrouds amp Garrouds case on the table to the right and click on one of the hasps to open it
Lift the cover on the compartment in the center and get the note on top
The one below is trivial
This top note holds an important clue and may be resolved by reading it literally including the small print at the bottom as follows quot Access codes to Holding Boxes in Vault the total sum of precious amp semi precious stones quot Take the time now to pursue this
On the PDA click on the upper left icon then on Jewels History
Double click on the ones for which you are carrying replicas the Imperial State Crown the Sovereign rsquo s Scepter and the Sovereign rsquo s Orb all of which will be listed as targeted
For each there is a listing of the gems they contain add them up pearls are not gems
The scepter and orb are together in a vault so add these totals
Now you have the codes to open the two vaults when you get to them
The vault number in which the items are kept is also given
Leave the closet and head down the hall
You will see a guard in a glass enclosed security office and clearly you can't go further without being seen
Past the elevator you have a one minute safety window because of the DLU you recently installed in the sewer go into the unisex toilet behind you where there is no security camera then click on the handle of the accordion door on the left so you can go in where the janitor supplies are stored
Click on a box of bleach on an upper shelf then click on it again to move it aside to reveal a shuttered ventilation opening
The latch in the right casing of the opening will open the shutters and you can see the guard at a console with his back to you
Use the crossbow and still frozen ice darts to take him out as you did the guard at Raleigh rsquo s Walk
In the Devereaux Tower control room you shut down all the alarm sensors for this area except the cameras and the System diagram indicated that these fed only to this guard who is now unconscious at his post
You are safe from discovery
Leave the toilet and go down the hall to the door of the security office that is just past the plant
Press the green button to the left of the door to open it
Inside you will see a lot of things but you need only one
Move to the console to the right of the guard where you will see two rectangular yellow buttons press the one labeled Leave the office and go to the large round vault door
Get a closeup of the panel on the left and insert the white security card with crest and blue rectangle in the slot to open the panel
Ignore the key hanging inside
You can now see three color coded locks two in the panel and one in the vault door put the appropriate key in each
Since you can't turn more than one key at a time put the key turn device over the yellow key then click on the device
It begins ticking then very shortly the ticks turn to beeps indicting the yellow key has turned when that happens immediately click on either the red or blue key
All done correctly the vault door swings open
Move into the tubular vault entrance and look up to the right to see a rocker switch that will open the gate at the end of the tube
Proceed into the vault until you see a white rectangle on the wall at the right
Click on it whereupon it will open to reveal a computer monitor and a slotted receptacle
Put one of the floppy disks in the slot and if it is rejected try the other one will stay in and the monitor will call for a superuser code
Of the three on page only one has the indicated characters it is also the only unused one left
After you enter the superuser code the monitor will display DOORS and LOG choose DOORS and then click on the icon to open the doors which you will hear happening
Click on the return arrow then choose LOG
A list of four authorized personnel will appear click on the trashcan by any one of them and his name will be dumped
This somehow authorizes Raven to take his place
Back off from the monitor which ejects the floppy disk and closes
Move into the area in front of the regalia vaults whereupon the doors roll shut trapping you in it
Not to worry
Go to vault and key in the code leading zeros to make digits that you have determined is the one for the Orb and Scepter
When the vault door swings open take them and then put in the fake ones from your knapsack and back off
Do the same for the Imperial Crown in vault
Raven has completed his mission now all he has to do is make his escape undetected and do as much as he can to remove evidence of his intrusion
Move to the center of the vault area and face the doors where a rectangle is faintly visible
Click on it three times the handprint scan is accepted and the doors open
Go to the wall monitor and put in the floppy disk and superuser code
When the display appears click on LOG use the trashcan icon to dump the red entry
Leave the vault using the rocker switch in the tubular entry section to close the gate and open the round vault door
Proceed to the elevator and press the button for floor
You can't go back through the regalia viewing area because the doors to that locale do not have a lock on this side but you have prepared an alternate route when you came here the first time
You know the way through the book lined hall the secret tunnel and into the sewer through the hole you made in the brick wall
You have shut down almost all of the security system so you must restore it
Go through the sewer to the Devereaux Tower and up to the control room first putting the gas mask on again as the knockout gas has not yet dissipated
Bring up the monitor and reactivate all the sensors by using theAtab
Return to the sewer where you have much tedious travel ahead of you
Retrieve the DLU that you put in the nearby Signal Junction Box then go to the Hospital Block and get the DLU that you left there
Finally go to the moat exit where you climb out and go to the Traitors Gate to meet the SEAL team that will take you safely away down the Thames
Commentary Some random thoughts that occurred to me while playing By the end of the game he has removed a very large number of items to inventory and not put them back virtually emptying at least one cabinet as well as a safe surely the absence of these articles will be noticed in time
A locked sewer gate with an alarm is left open and the alarm rendered ineffective with chewing gum even though this is in a remote area of the sewer there is a possibility of eventual discovery
When the sleeping guard in the hospital basement finally awakens she will be unable to find the keys that were in her lap
Perhaps she cannot report this without revealing that she was asleep on the job but she will need these keys sooner or later
Raven blows a hole in a brick wall large enough for passage even though this is in the sewer it must ultimately be discovered
After blowing itself up the mine is still in inventory
Does the secret opening clued by the walking stick of King Henry VIII close again or will it be glaringly open when personnel arrive in the morning
The note about it says it is opened by a falling weight this weight must be pulled up or the rope cut and the wall moved back in place
What about the three keys used to open the regalia vault
Are they still there in the locks awaiting discovery
A couple of the guards are laid low by ice darts in the unlikely event that they recover before being found unconscious and decide not to report that they have been out of action someone will surely realize that this not a prank and that there has been an intruder
Well let rsquo s hope that after all of Raven rsquo s trouble that the plan works and Major Anderson is caught and that an international incident is averted
And that I have not made any errors
GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
TRAITORS GATEWalkthroughVersion September BySteve Andersonrsvp bigbear u net com EXTRA MISSION BRIEFING This is an extremely detailed walkthrough Because of the non linear nature of the game it won t necessarily guide you by the quickest route What it will do is ensure you experience nearly everything that Daydream Software created for your enjoyment
TRAITORS GATE is a totally logical real time rpg adventure puzzle game So long as you approach it in as realistic a manner as possible you won t go far wrong You should always keep your brief in mind Get in do the switch and get out without leaving a trace This becomes quite important later on
While there is a real time limit of about hours this is more than ample to complete all the tasks and puzzles necessary The possible exception might be the sewers It s the only unmapped part of the game and you will definitely need one for down there I ve created one which should accompany this walkthrough and when printed out nicely fits onto a sheet of A paper but if it s not here you will find a copy at You will find a copy here Kb
If you would prefer to draw your own map I suggest that once you enter the sewers SAVE YOUR GAME and make your map saving into a separate slot as you go in order to conserve the real time factor
The whole layout down there is totally logical and while time consuming can be mapped relatively painlessly
When you are happy that you ve mapped the whole sewer area you can resume your mission from the main saved game file
Use your camera often It s one of the most useful items you have in your Inventory
There are no ridiculous or illogical puzzles here Everything has a purpose and all puzzles can be solved from in game clues So long as you give yourself ample time the whole experience should prove to be thoroughly enjoyable

Switch on your camera and when the green camera marks show take a picture of the parchment This picture is automatically relayed by e mail to ORPHIA at the Pentagon where a team of experts are standing by to analyse photographs and such for you After about a minute you will be alerted to an e mail reply Someone will have kindly translated the parchment for you It is wise to do this with all documents you find as well as display boards and panels and a number of other things
Take no notice of any snide remarks from ORPHIA if they tell you not to waste their time You re the one on the ground and know what you need answers to so they are wasting your time by not properly analysing what you need in the first place o Next go to the picture just right of the flat cabinet

Look at and photograph the portrait just left of the wardrobe ORPHIA will eventually tell you that the portrait is of Anne Boleyn painted for her execution
The date given is th May This gives you the code for the Chinese Box as
Historical Footnote ORPHIA suggests a corrected date of execution as They themselves are pretty headless as Anne Boleyn was in fact beheaded on Tower Green on th May
No matter The code you want is USE the card with Chinese number characters as a guide to the shapes GET the White Security Pass with green crest and blue square on it GET the Code for the Main Vault Doors both items are important

SAVE YOUR GAME
USE your Limpet Mine on the wall and switch it on You must immediately get as far away from the mine as possible or pay the price There is a second delay on the timer It doesn t matter whether you escape back the way you just came or go right toward the wooden steps
After the explosion examine the damage
I think this counts as one big OOPS All that noise not to mention the mess and what about your briefing Get in and get out without leaving any evidence o Go through the hole There are no prizes for guessing where you are
Now to find the graffiti in order to hack into the HOSPITAL computer
Make your way to theBEAUCHAMP EXIT on my map CD You surface in a garden
Watch out for the soldier and Beefeater Quickly go through the nearby door There to your left is the ancient graffiti Photograph it and while you are waiting for ORPHIA to reply start making your way back to THE OLD HOSPITAL BLOCK
You can either return the way you came via the BEAUCHAMP EXIT or more interestingly you can explore this whole area particularly the long passage beyond the unlocked barred gate Keep going Beyond the door is DEVEREUX TOWER
Go through Close by are spiral steps going up
Don t use them
Explore the service area then use the other exit into a grassy courtyard Go down the steps keep going forward and down the other steps
You reach a locked entrance to THE WATERLOO BLOCK
Remember this you ll need it later Return up the steps and instead of going back into DEVEREUX TOWER find the DEVEREUX EXIT on my map set into the grass It s in line with but just left of the tower door
Somewhere along the way ORPHIA will have informed you that the top line of graffiti in your photograph is EXTREMA It has the necessary letters for the Super User code too
CD TOWER OF LONDON SEWERS Devereux Exit Entrance on my map This is a bit of a trek I m afraid as everything is being done in real time but we now need to go back to the HOSPITAL EXIT on my map
CD OLD HOSPITAL BLOCK EXIT Ground Floor on my map Go through the door in front of you and return to THE HOSPITAL SECRET COMPUTER ROOM The door code is
UNDERSTANDING THE SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS USE the computer USE the blue Pin Code Generator numbered Enter pin number Enter Punch in the randomly generated digit Computer CODE Enter This generates the KEY code Type in the KEY on your KEYBOARD Enter Type in the Super User Code digits EXTREMA
Start by looking at the lower heading DOOR CODES
The information is split into two sectionsDEVEREUX Spelt DEVERAUX here and HOSPITAL These are both security centres The DEVERAUX diagram shows that the entrance exit dooris governed by two codes Entering is Leaving is the exact reverse
Pointing to a nearby box is the code This box is inside the security centre The HOSPITAL diagram shows a plan of the ground floor along with the two door codes you already have gets you into this room and gets you into the SECURITY BOSS S OFFICE
Now go to SYSTEMS It is split into three sections SYSTEM SYSTEM and SYSTEM At first this may appear extremely complex and confusing
SYSTEM Note the two red circles The left one is DEVEREUX the right one is HOSPITAL
The six boxed graphics down the side logically represent the different forms of security arrangements Box Telephone Links All pretty obvious but notice that both centres are linked Box Movement Sensor Any movement within the protected area will automatically trigger an alarm Note the cluster of six green squares in the middle
These are the regalia Vaults Box Body Heat Sensor
Pretty obvious Box Pressure Pads Step on these and ring that bell Box Alarmed Doors Totally obvious Box Video Surveillance This is the most vital and interesting at this point The two purple squares are Surveillance Equipment boxes
They are the nerve centres for the video cameras It is vital that you tamper with them Remember the boxes on the wall next door They are one of your targets SYSTEM Flick through the options You are looking at the overall security arrangements for the whole TOWER COMPLEX SYSTEM This is specific to the REGALIA In particular note the new red spot This is another security centre close to the actual regalia Vaults
Close down the computer then SAVE YOUR GAME into a file called something like Computer or Security System You can then re check security codes and arrangements again really easily if you need to without coming back here every five minutes
Go to the next room Touch the left Surveillance Equipment Box There are video camera sockets with Link V C on the right USE your Scart adapter by dragging it from your Inventory and placing it on each of the sockets in turn From your PDA switch on the Video Equipment item in your user manual See what you ve got Repeat the Scart adapter dragging process for each socket Sockets show external video surveillance Sockets show a blank screen Your DLU Digital Loop Unit See your user manual for explanation will fit into the Link V C but don t leave it there Open the right hand Surveillance Equipment Box Sockets amp show a blank screen Sockets show internal video surveillance of the external office of the Devereux security centre This is where you need your safe window of seconds Socket shows the spiral stairs you will arrive up
Place one of your two Digital Loop Units in the Link V C and remember to SWITCH IT ON Exit the box
Your next objective is obvious Time to get inside the Devereux security centre
Make your way by the sewers to No I ll show you a nice little scenic route EASTER EGG instead
CD TOWER OF LONDON SEWERS Hospital Exit Entrance Make your way to theWAKEFIELD EXIT on my map CD
Your surroundings will be immediately recognisable For orientation purposes face the door To the left of the door a ball and chain are hanging from a hook
Next is a corner defined by a wooden support beam On another hook to the left of that is a set of leg restraints Follow the line of that wall to the floor The bottom centre brick has a metal peg sticking out of it USE the Ring Pull Handle on the peg
SECRET EASTER EGG PASSAGE CD USE the yellow flash lamp and explore Find the Cubby Hole and two items for your Inventory For fun get ORPHIA to decipher them for you o Continue to the end of the passage Up the steps twice but before you push the stone with the bolts you may want to SAVE YOUR GAME into something like Secret Passage so that you can easily visit here again
Now push the stone
You will recognise where you are The reason for saving your game was because you can t unfortunately enter the passage from this end With the game saved you can return along the passage and see how you get back out at the other end DEVEREUX TOWER SECURITY CENTRE Quick Briefing We need to get into the security centre without being seen Barring the timer on the Limpet mine this part is the only critically timed piece of the whole mission It involves locating the oxygen store just past the main security room door
Beware this room is also under surveillance You need to close off the oxygen supply to the inner control room filling the system with the Isoflurane knock out gas you have it in your Inventory and then enter the inner control room You will need to wear your gas mask at all times to achieve this
Remember that because you have activated your DLU you can remain stationary in video camera view for a maximum of seconds before the alarm will go off
USE your compass item in your user manual and flick the switch toward the bottom This will activate the DLU tracking unit and will sound a useful warning in good time for when you should temporarily move to a new location
Watch and listen to it now a couple of times as it does its stuff
It is vital to work relatively quickly and when the DLU tracker sounds leave what you are doing and go to a different location
USE your gas mask drag it from your Inventory to the centre of the screen
Now just before you go it s a good idea to bring the gas cylinder round in your Inventory so that it s ready to grab when the time comes
Prepare all this and SAVE YOUR GAME
OK Raven let s do it
Up the spiral steps Straight ahead Ignore the locked door in front of you Turn around Go to the end of the room passing the inner security control on your right you will have time to pause and see the guard working Locate the oxygen store second door on the right It s red and has a No Naked Flame notice on it
YOU MAY WANT TO SAVE YOUR GAME HERE
With an eye and ear on your DLU tracker enter the oxygen store Quickly note the oxygen cylinders to your right Go to the machine at the far end of the room Inspecting the machine you will see it s split into five sections one for each of the oxygen cylinders There is nothing tricky here the left most controls operate the left most oxygen bottle and so forth
At this point you may need to run for cover from the surveillance system Leave the room Wait a few seconds then return
Close to the bottom of the machine are the AUTO MANUAL OFF switches TURN OFF all of the switches except the one in the middle Turn this to MANUAL
With the middle switch at MANUAL repeatedly press the middle gold disk escape valve above it until it stops hissing oxygen and the needle in the gauge above the valve plunges to zero you have just cleared the pipe of oxygen That s the machine set
At this point run for cover again Leave the room If you didn t get caught on camera SAVE YOUR GAME
Wait a few seconds then return Stand in front of the MIDDLE oxygen cylinder USE the GAS cylinder from your Inventory and fix the lead to the middle oxygen cylinder click on the oxygen cylinder neck Turn the red tap of the GAS bottle fully on two clicks Immediately the pressure on the gas gauge should drop to zero
If it doesn t quickly move back to the far machine Hit the MANUAL button again pump out the oxygen and this time stay with it Attach the gas to the oxygen cylinder and strike the red button
As soon as the gas gauge drops to zero you are safe
You will know when you ve got it right but just to be sure look through the inner office window The guard will be unconscious so you won t be able to see him o Well done
SPECIAL MISSION NOTE A lot of people have had dreadful problems with this puzzle
Sometimes they get caught on camera or simply can't work fast enough
Fear not help is on hand Instead of turning the AUTO MANUAL OFF switches to OFF turn them ALL to MANUAL This should avoid the problem You need both files one is the graphic the other is the game file They complete this puzzle for you and put you back in your mission just outside the red fire door
Onward
INNER CONTROL ROOM USE the White Security Pass with green crest and blue square on it on the code unit Key in the pass code
You can now turn off the DLU tracker but leave your gas mask on Explore the room At the back of the green computer file log you will find anotherPin Code Generator number G If you use it you will need the pin number hidden below the cooking stove inside the lid of the coffee tin

While exploring here you will have found the locked cabinet This is the box from the HOSPITAL diagram that we have the code for
Unfortunately we need the key so Go to the guard s body andGET the slim oblong key with one wavy side from his trouser pocket
USE the key on the locked cabinet The combination lock is calling for a digit code The one you ve got has so just leave off the zero
The code is Touch the large gold bar GET the Blue handled key It matches the Red handled key you found earlier and judging from the box there s a third one to complete the set

THE IMPERIAL STATE CROWN sits alone in Vault
It s simply a case of accessing the information in your PDA under Jewels History and counting up the total of gems in each Vault
