Note The first symbol is a zero How you would reason that I'm not sure but it is not an alpha symbol

THE SECURED FILE PUZZLE rd button click th button clicks nd button clicks st button clicks th button clicks The unit opens to reveal an array of office supplies Find the hand cursor at the bottom edge of the drawer to note that there's more storage underneath Find the birth certificate stolen from you at the Gusum Factory Also find Leonard's dastardly quot to do quot list with only the first item checked off Hmm he's forgotten the crow bar
Close the drawer to find even more storage Find a description of the deadly poison sodium monofluoroacetate
Wow Has Leonard poisoned poor Richard Svensson Maybe we'd better find that crow bar that is mentioned on Leonard's list
Pick up theBATTERYbefore you leave Exit to THE FISKEBY STATION Go forward to the right and around the station house Go forward twice Turn right Go forward twice Turn left to see an old metal pot and beyond it a T shaped metal support Go under it and up the hill twice Turn left to see a bunker Go inside Use your bicycle lamp to investigate the dark room to the left Use your magnifying glass then the hand cursor on the wooden box to the right Its empty
Close the box back out and turn left with the magnifying glass on a second storage box You'll hear Carol says that quot its nailed shut quot We sure do need a crow bar or a hammer Back out of the room and find the magnifying glass symbol in front of the dark room next door to the right You'll find this area identical to the one on the left but there is no action or item available here
We really need to find that crow bar Back out Turn around Go forward right forward more times

Click on the wooden box to the left Use the crow bar to open it Find a letter with quot Elvira quot written on the envelope FINALE First there's a note from Erik explaining that he'd hidden the letter from her while she quot collected her thoughts quot presumably after his untimely death
Second there's a letter from Regina Kohler Samuel Kohler's wife and Leonard's mother She outlines the affair between Elvira Wallin and Samuel and the circumstances around Viktor's birth
The third letter reveals that Erik had not initially known the Viktor was not his son Erik refusing to believe the contents of Regina's letter had subsequently found out he was impotent
That fact established without a doubt that he could not be Viktor's birth father Consequently drinking heavily and having lost his job Erik could not bear all this trauma and he tragically ended his own life
Learn finally that Leonard did try to eliminate poor struggling Richard with rat poison
Carol's offering of evidence to the Norrkoping police revealed that Leonard wanted all the inheritance from his father
He killed Viktor so he could have the Salt Field Shelter inheritance and he attempted to kill Richard because Leonard thought Viktor may have told Richard some sort of secret perhaps having to do with the inheritance Carol explains the conclusion in detail so the whole story is told
Congratulations You've helped Carol solve a complex murder mystery and you deserve all the credit Leonard is cooling his heels in prison where he'll be for a long time

Ecstatica II WalkthroughBy Chris Nielsenchris ldr com Step by step guide to getting through Ecstatica II alive This walkthrough won't take you to all the places on the map such as the moat so your percentage explored ratingwon't be if you follow this exactly
Feel free to wander around though the scenery in this game is absolutely breathtaking
If you see a problem with the walkthrough or something doesn't make sense let me know and I'll fixitchris ldr com
I don't believe walkthroughs should be writ in stone
Places in bold are listed on the map that came with the game
Last updated August Pieces of the Eldersign First Second Third Fourth Fifth Sixth SeventhItems needed Medallion st Armor Ring nd Armor st Device nd Device Lantern ScrollFirst Eldersign PieceThroughout this document I'll be refering to the cardinal directions
Refer to the map that came with the game tosee which direction I'm talking about
At the beginning of the game you start off in the Stocks
After listening to thepriestess you 'll be set free
The first thing you want to do is get a weapon so go east to the Craftsmans Guild Enter the building and head toward the blacksmith
Get the sword that is leaning against the table then leave the Craftsmans Guild
Continue going east past the well to the Guard Tower
Break open the door at the base of the tower which is the one next to the wagon and the green slime on the ground
Once inside the tower you will see an inactive teleportation plate and a flight of stairs to the left
Go up the stairs but watch out for the noxious jets of gas coming outof the wall
On the way up the stairs you will pass four landings
On the fourth landing there's lots of treasure behind a locked blue door that you won't be able to get to until later
Continue upward until you get to the top
Once there youwill then see a key sitting on top of a gargoyle head
Stand next to the head instead of in front of it and then hit it otherwise you'll set off a trap which will skewer you Get the key and open the door
You will see two sets of stairs
One set of stairs just leads to a chest and a health potionin the tower above you whereas the other stairs go to the top of the next tower
Go up the stairs past an inactive teleportation plate between two stone gargoyles and then down the stairs on the other side
A portcullis will closebehind you when you walk down the stairs You are now on a walkway that leads to the Prison Tower the tallest tower on the map
Go past the tower until youreach the closed portcullis on the other side of the walkway avoiding the gargoyles on the way and get the armorwhich is floating there
Go back to the prison tower get zapped by the two guardians and then make your way up the stairs
Skip the first locked door and make your way to the second door
Break it down kill the beastie and get the key
Go back down to the locked door and set the priestess free
This will activate the teleportation plates you saw earlier
Listen to her message then go back up to the very top of the tower to pick up the staff which is lying there
Go backdown the tower
Hit the two gargoyles heads
One head opens the portcullis on the left and the other head opens the portcullis on the right
Continue going north to the previously closed portcullis which should now open
Walk down the stairs opposite another closed portcullis and hit the black gargoyle head there
Go back up the stairs to the now opened portcullis and turn left
In the upper left of the screen there is an entranceway where you can go either left or right
Go left and enter the Attic
You are going to be spending some time on this level searching for levers and switches so you can open the Main Hall Complex
Wander around until you find the blue gargoyle head hit it then find the area where the three levers are located
Hit the blue lever
This will open a portcullis on this level where you will find a chest containing a blue key which will open the blue door also on this level
Go through the blue door and hit the green gargoyle head not the gold one
Go back to where the levers are located and hit the green lever
This opens up another portcullis on this level where you will find a chest containing a purple key
Naturally this one opens the purple door
Inside the room behind the purple door is a red gargoyle head
Hit this head and then go back and hit the red lever Go back to the blue door room and hit the gold gargoyle head which will then open the two portcullises in that room
Behind one of the opened portcullises is a two star sword some treasure and another gold gargoyle head
Hit the head and grab everything
Leave the Attic and head back toward the Prison Tower
Continue on toward the teleportation plate and stand on it
This will take you down to ground level
Go to the courtyard next to the well
Hit the big door north of the well
This leads into the Main Hall Complex
Lots of interesting things in here
If you turn right immediately you will see a sword propped up against a statue
Continue down this hall
There's a archway that's not obvious on the right wall of this corridor that leads to a bunch of treasure which you might want to grab
Continue down the hallway and turn left at the end
Down this hall bash in the second door on the right go in that room and you'll find a three star mace
If you continue to explore you will eventually find a book you can pick up
You won't be able to do anything with this right now but stash it somewhere like in the main hall so you can get it easily later
This book is used to open up a secret passage that will allow you to explore some of the lower levels but they are currently blocked by a blue door that you won't be able to open until later
If you continue to explore the main floor you will also find a stairway leading down
If you follow this stairway you will come out in a room with an archway at the left of the screen and another archway that isn't obvious at the bottom of the screen
The one at the bottom will take you out into the garden next to the castle where you can wander for a bit but you won't be able to do too much else here either When you are done exploring go back to the main hall and head up the right stairway
Halfway up the stairs a shadow warrior will appear
Kill him then go back downstairs
Now head up the other staircase and kill the second shadow warrior who will drop the first piece of the Eldersign
Now go back to the right stairway and go upstairs
At the top of the stairs walk straight ahead
Go through the left doorway and then walk into the next room where you will find the Warlock
Kill him and dispatch all the other beasties who will come chasing after you
Go back the way you came and use the crystal ball then listen to the priestess's message
You can now explore the upper level of the main hall if you wish
You'll find two gold gargoyle heads that open the two portcullises behind each of which is lots of treasure always a good thing to have if you find you need to boost your health at some point via F
Once you've exhausted all the areas go ahead and leave the main hall Second Eldersign PieceOnce back outside head toward the Guard Tower again
You will see a building to the left of the Guard Tower which is the stables
Enter the stables and in the room with the horse is a doorway in the upper left corner
Go through this doorway into another room and head down the ladder
Hit the gargoyle head go through the portcullis and then take the stairs going down
The stairs goingup only go to another red dot door
Once you arrive at the bottom of the stairs you're going to be wandering around in another maze for awhile
Walk around until you find the a giant monster getting drunk
Next to him are three bottles
Pick up the purple middle bottle and go back to the well in the courtyard
Walk toward the monster sitting on top of the well approaching him from the south
He'll grab the bottle out of your hand take a swig and then disintegrate
After he's gone go down the well Downstairs you will find three levers
Hit all of them and go through the big door to the right
You'll find some treasure and a magic weapon in the cell with the skeletons
Normally I don't pick up the magic weapons since when they run out of juice they're pretty useless
Also make a note of the cage containing a teleportation plate
We'll be coming back to this soon
Go back the way you came until you are back out in the courtyard
Go south from the well until you are facing the Healer's Tower
Enter the archway to the right of the Healer's Tower going past the horse standing there
You will now be outside next to the moat
Head up the stairs to the second level
Wander around on this level until you come to a room that has a door leaning up against the right wall
There is a ladder in the upper right corner of this room that isn't obvious
Climb the ladder and wander around on the second level until you find a second ladder then climb it also
This will take you to the roof
Go up the stairs to the top of the chimney then fall into the chimney
You will land in the cage you saw earlier at which point you'll be teleported to another room
From here you are able to access the catacombs an area which I think is graphically amazing Go south until you are in the room with the three staircases two going down and one going up
Go down the left stairway and wander around in the catacombs until you find a flashing skull
Pick it up then go back to the three staircases
Go up the stairs until you find a big locked door with numerous skulls sitting on pedestals
Walk up to one of the empty pedestals and place the skull on it
Go back down to the catacombs to find the next flashing skull and bring it back to the pedestal room
For the third skull you will need to find in the catacombs another stairway going down
This will lead you into a large cavern with a lake in the middle Walk to the edge of the lake until you see flashing dots over the water
This is an invisible walkway to get over to the other side
Follow the blinking lights until you are on the othe r side of the lake
Look for a doorway underneath a horned skull
Go under the horned skull to the right and get the third and final flashing skull
The red door at the end of this passageway will take you outside the castle but you need to have the Medallion to open it
Go back upstairs to the room with the pedestals and place the skull on the final one
The door will open
Go through and get the second piece of the Eldersign
Next get the first important item the Medallion from the skeleton sitting on the throne then pick up the large cross and place it at the front of the skeleton
This will allow you to pick up the third Eldersign later
Then pick up the small cross which will open the gate to the Graveyard
Since you now have the Medallion you can finally open all the doors with the red dots on them Third Eldersign PieceNow head back to the first room where you appeared on this level
Use the crystal ball listen to the priestess's message then open the red dot door
This will lead you back to the well
Climb out of the well and head up the stairs to the left of the Hospital Tower
Behind the red door is a small room with a passage to the north and south
If you head north over the green slime you can get a four diamond axe
If you go south you can pick up some boots some treasure and some potions Now if you make your way to the farthest left tower on the map the one next to the Craftsman's Guild you can open the red door about midway up it and go into an eerily red lit tower
You can either go down and kill the beasties at the bottom or go outside to the ledge and climb a ladder leading up
On the top floor you can find a shield to help dodge the blows
To leave the tower you need to make a running jump out the lower left door way onto the roof of the adjoining tower as you can't climb back down the ladder which is kind of stupid if you ask me Go back to the main courtyard and head toward the patch of green slime on the ground that's blocking an archway
Either get some boots from the room above the stables or just try and jump over the green slime
Once inside hit the black gargoyle head then return to the courtyard
Head towards the big portcullis located to the right of the well
This will open and you can now go to the drawbridge Hit the lever which will open the drawbridge and go outside
Go down once and go left through some bushes the path isn't really obvious here then go straight to the Graveyard
You will automatically open the gate using the little cross you got from the skeleton earlier
Enter the church and head toward the skeleton
In his hand is the Silver Sword which is the ONLY weapon that will kill the werewolves not those other glowing two star swords you find lying around contrary to whatever the docs say
Once you have sword in hand head back out of the church
Go to the back of the Graveyard and find the entrance to the underground tomb which is a sort of mini maze
Here you will find the second important item Permanent Armor being guarded by fireball wielding mummies
Kill the guards grab the armor and go back outside Now go back to the church and hit the unlit candle next to the skeleton
This will move the altar out of the way exposing a staircase Drop the silver sword and pick up your axe again
Go down the stairs into an underground passage which looks like it dead ends but against the end is a ladder that's hard to see so just hit the space bar and climb up into part of the Wilderness
Head south to the next screen and turn immediately to the right
You will see a piece of the Eldersign so smack the plant guarding it and go pick it up
If you haven't put the big cross in front of the skeleton earlier you won't be able to kill this plant
This will also give you a strength boost
I found in this area that launching my own magic fireballs at the plants works very well for clearing the path
And it seemed that most of the plants left behind a magic scroll to keep that power boosted
Your mileage may vary Fourth Eldersign PieceContinue exploring the Wilderness until you find the Big Clearing with the amazon women
Kill the amazons which shouldn't be too hard if you still have the four star axe and head to the top left
This will bring you into a cave
Head to the top exit and kill the Sorceress
Get the third important item the Ring then go back out into the clearing and collect the nearby Eldersign piece
Go back into the cave stand between the four obelisks and teleport to the Graveyard
Similar to the Medallion the Ring allows you to open the blue doors Fifth Eldersign PieceAt this point you can do a little exploring since you can now open both the red and blue doors
The first thing to do is get the five star sword
So from the Graveyard teleport to the Wilderness then teleport to the Guard Tower then teleport to the top of the Guard Tower and then go down to the treasure room on the fourth landing the room that was locked with a blue door
Pick up the treasure and sword then go back out to the main courtyard then climb the steps on the outside of the Guard Tower the ones that are next to the drawbridge portcullis You will arrive in a room with a guard sitting in the corner who will see you and stagger up to press the attack
Hack him up then go past the swinging axe through the next room and out onto the ledge
Go to the door to the left and into the room with the bombs
Go through it being careful of the bombs and up the steps on the side of the next tower
Go through the blue door turn right and pass through the passage right next to the blue door Climb the steps until you reach the top of the tower
You will see the fourth important item the Strange Device protected by spinning globes You need to kill the Wizard before you can get to it
Go through the door in the upper left and teleport to the top of the tower
Walk around the top until the Wizard appears and kill him
Grab the fifth important item the second set of Permanent Armor then enter the blue teleporter globe which will take you back to the Device
Go down one flight of stairs and walk straight forward to go outside the tower on the right side of the screen
Go through the blue door and get the next piece of the Eldersign
Go down to the second last level of the tower and walk outside through the doorway with the skull
Find the crystal ball and listen to the priestess
You can now either take the teleport or do some more exploring
I suggest the latter and then come back here to teleport back to the Wilderness If you do want to do some more exploring find your way back to the main courtyard
Remember that book you found earlier
Well go to the Main Hall Complex and look for a red locked door down the hall where you found the mace
Go though the red door over to the glowing place on the shelf
Part of the bookcase will open up and you will be able to get to the lower levels
Go down the stairs through the blue door and check out the lower levels for health potions and other fun things like the torture chamber and the charnel house or go down the stairway located elsewhere in the Main Hall Complex and explore the dungeons and the treasure house
All of these places aren't necessary to finish the game but you do get tons of treasure exploring them Sixth Eldersign PieceTeleport to the Wilderness and make your way to the Village
In the Village find the well and locate the house with the open ledge facing it
Go into the house and from the second floor take a running jump into the well
Go through the door at the bottom of the well and find the second Device
After picking this up the Village is now populated with people
Go to the church in the Village use the crystal ball and listen to the priestess
Then follow the directions the people of the town give you to reach the Hunter's Lodge
Go into the room with the stuffed bear and hit it's arm
Then go to the fireplace in the other room and get the Lantern Go back to the Village and find the pond
Go around it into the Forest and find the Old Ruin then go through the glowing teleport which will take you to the top of the cliffside
In the top left of the screen you will see a doorway
Jump up to the doorway go down the hall and through the teleport
This will take you to the domain of the Necromancer From the first room go north past the inactive crystal ball
Follow the path into the Necromancer's room
Kill him and get the sixth piece of the Eldersign
You now have all the items you need to go the final part of the game the Dark Tower
Find the teleport that has a checker board pattern for the floor
Save your game here since the Dark Tower is on a time limit ferchrissakes
Now go through the teleporter Seventh Eldersign PieceThe Dark Tower consists of seven floors
It is also on a time limit and you can see how much time you have left by pressing the enter key and examing the hourglass
I found this part of the game to be exceedingly tedious and out of place with the rest of the areas I explored
Anyway here's some notes on how to get past these levels
I'm not going into great detail for this section but you can get the gist of it st Floor Go to the furthest chest on the right and get the key inside
Then go through the area that was blocked by the blinking lights and teleport to the second floor nd Floor Go to the chest that is furthest south on the left the go through the area that was blocked by the blinking lights to teleport to the third floor rd Floor Go to the sourthernmost chest in the lower left corner then up to the two gargoyles teleport hit the chest next to you enter the four gargoyles teleport kill the floating skeleton teleport open the chest teleport head toward the southernmost chest again teleport to the beginning and head toward the center blue gargoyles to teleport to the fourth floor th Floor Go to the closest chest to the left then the furthest chest to the right then the furthest chest to the left then into the center and teleport to the fifth floor th Floor Open the southernmost chest go to nothern most chest then go to teleporter to the sixth floor th Floor Go to the chest avoiding the teleporters and when the screen switches go to the teleporter on the left teleport kill the floating skeleton but do not go through the gnashing doors instead go to the right teleport go to the left teleport enter the teleport next to you teleport then go right through the exit and teleport to the final level th Floor Go straight north thru gnashing doors to the right pick up Eldersign then thru gnashing doors to the top past the blades go south to get some shoes go back to blades and go left get Scroll from chest continue on past spikes past slime go left past gnashing door don't enter the four gargoyle teleporter go north past blade go left through a non obvious archway don't open first chest go north to second chest then into small room to teleport Take out the Archmage and watch the ending

You can study each Harvey rsquo s range of ldquo moves rdquo by clicking on the Harvey icon on the bottom right menu and then reading the explanations by hovering the mouse over the moves that show up in the bottom left menu
Once you have used a move the Harvey in the lower right menu or in the case of combination moves two Harveys will have a red ldquo can rsquo t be used anymore rdquo icon over it them ndash these Harvey rsquo s cannot be used again until the next round
The corresponding Harveys on the game board will also be grayed out
Each round is over when you rsquo ve used all the Harveys and then the red ldquo can rsquo t be used rdquo icons disappear and the grey Harveys on the gameboard regain their color
Points are listed for each Harvey and for each devil opponent
If you find yourself behind in points and realize that a loss is inevitable you can choose to Escape and then start over again from scratch
WATCH OUT BELOW
SERIOUS STRATEGY SPOILERS Combination and Magic Moves In my experience combinations and magic moves are more useful than the straight ldquo strike out rdquo attacks
Use the straight ldquo strike out rdquo attacks only when you don rsquo t have anything else useful left in terms of combinations or magic
The Harveys with the best stuff in terms of attacking IMHO are the Alcohol Harvey Location shooting Harvey and the Berserker
Strangely sometimes a straight ldquo strike out rdquo attack wasn rsquo t effective against a selected opponent though it was always effective against the opponents who happen to be each Harvey rsquo s direct counterpart direct counterparts are listed below The only times that attacks didn rsquo t work against direct counterparts were fire or shooting attacks while the Spider and the Snowman were protecting against those particular forms of attacks more information on the protection racket below
Direct Counterparts Listening Harvey ndash Spider Fire Harvey ndash Snowman Berserker angry Harvey NPC monk look alike Lying Harvey ndash Justitia Location shooting Harvey ndash Wendigo Sharp Harvey ndash Dragon Alcohol Harvey Genie Devils and Their Quirks For the devils opponents the most dangerous in terms of attacking from what I could tell were the genie the NPC monk looking thing and the Wendigo The snowman and the spider were huge obstacles in a different way because they could protect their allies from fire attacks Snowman and shooting attacks Spider
The Dragon and Justitia seemed less dangerous ndash you can leave them to be defeated last
Just about any fire or shooting attack triggers protection for the opponents a shield shows up near the Spider or the Snowman that describes the type of protection
While they are in protection mode fire attacks if the Snowman is in protection mode and shooting attacks if the Spider is in protection mode appear to be useless
Combo moves that include fire if the Snowman is protecting or shooting if the Spider is protecting also won rsquo t work
Lowering the Spider and or Snowman points until they stop the protection feature is a top priority
Hit them with your Best Shot Despite the Spider and Snowman I would suggest starting out with the Berserker and Location shooting combo or the Fire and Alcohol combo
Each of these combo moves will damage devils opponents in one go
When you select the targets make sure the Snowman and the Spider are two of the targets on the first round BEFORE they rsquo ve put up protection
Once the Spider protection goes up the Location shooting Harvey rsquo s ability to cause significant damage is reduced
Once the Snowman protection goes up the Fire Harvey rsquo s ability to cause significant damage is reduced
So you rsquo ll have to maximize what the other Harveys can accomplish
For example the Sharp Harvey in magic double damage mode is good against the Spider or the Snowman even after both protections are instituted as is the Berserker and Alcohol combo
Other Harveys in straight ldquo strike out rdquo attack mode can wear down the Spider and the Snowman though more slowly than the other moves I just mentioned
More Fun Moves Berserker Magic ndash motivate a Harvey to act again
This means that a Harvey that has a red ldquo can rsquo t be used rdquo icon can be selected in order to remove its red ldquo can rsquo t be used rdquo icon allowing it another turn in that particular round
Who knew
Location and Listening Combo ndash protects allies
This protects Harveys that you select at least for a while
I usually used this move in the second or third round
For some reason using it seems to increase some of the opponents rsquo point totals
This protection move appears to protect only OTHER Harveys ndash when I tried to use it on the Location shooting Harvey himself as one of the three to be protected it did not appear to work
I suppose the guy with the gun has to be radically unselfish
Alcohol Magic Healing ndash you can use this move when a Harvey is approaching points
You can also heal a Harvey that has already reached points though this does seem to trigger an increase in points for each of the remaining opponents
Alcohol Harvey can even heal himself
Berserker and Alcohol Combo Harvey acts times ndash the red ldquo can rsquo t be used rdquo icon doesn rsquo t show up until after the selected Harvey has attacked thrice
Listening Magic Move protect Harvey with sound shield ndash this doesn rsquo t do much
From what I could tell it works for only one move
Maybe it is useful if you have a Listening Harvey move left near the end of a round and want to try to protect a Harvey with a low point total
Oddities Lying Harvey and trust issues Lying Harvey rsquo s ability to make opponents betray other opponents and work for you is so tricky it is almost useless apparently he can rsquo t hide his lyin rsquo eyes
Examples include the Listening and Lying combo opponent attacks allies and is blocked and the Lying Magic move opponent fights for you
I never did get these to work well
If you feel like experimenting with Lying Harvey rsquo s moves using different opponents there are probably ways to get these moves to work to your advantage
If you elect the lazy way though I suggest staying away from these moves
Use Lying Harvey only in straight ldquo strike out rdquo attacks
At times all the opponents suddenly had little green images above them and gained points
I couldn rsquo t figure out how to generate that particular effect for the Harveys
Apparently Mother Superior doesn rsquo t fight fair
I guess that rsquo s what it takes to be superior
I am absolutely certain that there are strategy intricacies that I missed in the ldquo Mother Superior vs Lilli rdquo challenge
But the above should make it possible to understand what rsquo s going on enough to win

Now he wants to be sure you're one of them so it's time for a little test
First part of the test is to pick the four items of Seth's crimes
Choose wisely Oudjat eye Small Column Tit Knot and Djed Pillar
Put them all in your inventory
Now it's time for a riddle

To do so you have to examine three things your document the inscriptions on the wall to your right and the inscriptions on the wall panel near the woman Look at the document especially the square drawing with the stones round and square edged on it

Then go to room D and get the kohl make up
Use the mirror in this same room or in room B and wear the wig and use the kohl Go to the servant near the stairs and talk to her
Then show her the necklace
She tells you this will complete your outfit
Then use the stairs to get upstairs and join the party
Once you are on the second floor you can talk to the noblemen in the back and join them in drinking
Five glasses of booze won't kill you the sixth will
But then again it won't help you
You can also talk to the noble Lady but again nothing is gained here
Go to the terrace which can be reached by going to one of the curtains
Examine the game of Senet on the table and place the Senet piece you found on the empty square
Now get the document from your inventory and put it on the question mark in your inventory
Look at the document and then put the icon of it back in your inventory
The document itself can still be examined
Move the cursor around till you get the explanation text sayingHeri Pedjet Ptah Nefer
This is a code
Now click away the document and look at the Senet game again
All four names are on the board
Click on it in the order mentioned above and a secret compartment will open Important After this the game of Senet will have to be played
As you are not known with the game you best save the game here
Now click on the secret compartment and get the map of the temple
Now automatically the game of Senet will start
As the description of the game and it's rules in the booklet is very good I won't explain it to you again
Just use the booklet
One hint though read it very carefully especially about those special fields used in the game
The best advice here is to play the game over and over again till you can beat your opponent
It's not a very difficult game just needs some luck and expertise
Just do it
When you've won the game Panehesy won't let you go
He's a bad loser so head for the balcony and jump down to escape
Look around and see Aamerout
Go talk to her twice and she'll give you new information on the conspiracy and the way to proceed your investigation
Then go inside the temple by clicking on the direction to the palm trees
Inside facing the woman make a turn and keep on walking to the end
Then turn left walk forward twice and turn right
There's a tunnel here which leads to a staircase
Go up all the way to the roof
Mention the wooden door halfway and remember it
On the roof talk to the standing priest
You must do some stargazing
Click on the sitting priest with the new required item and aim at the biggest and brightest star
It's right above the priest
Capture the star in the triangle shaped hole and click
Then enter the staircase again and go back to the wooden door
Enter and talk to the priest
Tell him the star is exactly above the priest
After that click on the basin and then click 'away' again
Talk to the priest and tell him the water shows you the th hour
Then the priest vanishes
After that get the small dish from the floor
Look at the basin again and click on it with the small dish
The water disappears and use the knife on the marks on the bottom
They will reveal two elements of the stolen stuff
Then look at the map of the temple found during the Senet sequence which shows you the location of the other part of it and go down the stairs
This part might be a bit difficult as all locations look the same
Once you see the pillars again don't move but turn to the right
Then take on step forward and walk towards the end and take one turn to the right
At last take one step forward
The pillar to you right and front is the one you should examine
There's a piece of stone missing
Look at it and get the second piece
Now go back to the temple entrance and show both pieces to the girl
The game will shift to another location
The movie clip shows you the rituals and finally your conversation with To
Tell him the story so far Then tear Ptahnefer's tunic of and reveal a necklace
Place both items you found in the temple on the necklace and don't mind his accusations
When the second piece is in place he'll be found guilty and taken away
The glory and the treasury is yours
The Gods have been with you and you've successfully completed the game

Talk to him When the initial conversation is over turn to see Imennakht the scribe from the tomb Talk to him also When he is finished talking click the Casket with the dagger from Tchai's house on him He will tell you that you need to find Tchai whom you suspect of murdering Hori by going to the Embalmer's shop and posing as Tchai's assistant
You must now deliver the casket Click on the floor mat to sleep and dream When you are awakened by Penmenefer you will find yourself outside the village again ready to find the Embalmer's workshop

Turn back into the first room and talk to the Embalmer who has reappeared there He pays you debens and asks you to follow him because you need to answer a few questions Uh oh
Follow the Embalmer into the room behind where he was standing He is waiting for you and now wants you to give him the amulets connected with the evil deeds of the god Seth as a sign of recognition You need to choose the four correct amulets Pass your cursor over each amulet until you get a question mark Then click for more description of what each amulet means Remember that the key word is Seth
Here's the layout of the amulets Oudjat Eye Heart Scarab Serpent's headlight blue dark blue pale green Ousekh necklace gray Djed Pillar Vulture Ouadj sm column Tit Knotmed

Leave Djehouty's house and go back to the Temple When you get there go to the entry between the two huge statues Walk around the building on either side and enter Sakhmet's shrine at the rear of the building You can click on Sakhmet's statue to send a prayer for help However it might be more productive to look down and find an interesting impression in the floor If you guessed that the little hand mirror will fit nicely in there you are so correct Place the mirror in the impression
Nothing more is happening Look at the legible parchment again in your inventory in closeup using the eye icon Do you see the Sakhmet statue and what looks like beams of light reflected from somewhere high up off to the left Exit this view Replace the parchment in inventory and scan the wall of the shrine to your left You will find a small rectangular stone that apparently can be removed That is if you had a mallet The mallet is also shown on the legible parchment but isn't easily recognized
Leave the Sakhmet shrine and go straight ahead back into the storehouse area Go through the second courtyard where you found the Great Seer earlier Go down the row of storage rooms to the next to last one on your left Go inside to find Irou arms crossed standing in the far right corner Go to him and ask him for his mallet He's being selfish Choose the first conversation option which begins Listen closely Irou Irou will be sufficiently intimidated and will turn over themalletimmediately Put it in your inventory
Go back to Sakhmet's shrine
Use the mallet on the small stone on the left side of the shrine wall In the following cutscene you will see the stone open to allow a beam of sunlight to enter The light bounces off the mirror and onto Sakhmet's statue
The statue moves over to the right There's an opening under the statue and a valuable papyrus is hidden there
Pick up thepapyrus Use the eye icon to read it Wonderful
You have found the recipe for making the antidote the medicine to cure Djehouty and all the other stricken people of Helipolis
You must waste no time in visiting the vendors in the Neighborhood But before you leave the area you might want to go back to Irou in the store house
And if you haven't found them already get a fist full ofcarroway seeds andjuniperberriesfrom the baskets on the right side of the room going in Get thebean flourfrom the middle wall cabinet on the left side of the room
Leave the Temple area and go back to the Neighborhood Go all the way down the street to the vendor nearest the dead end the last stall Talk to Maya the vendor and go down the list that appears to see which if any of the remedy ingredients she has in her inventory You will find that she has none of it Ah but does she have other wares that you might be able to use for advantageous trading
Give her the jeweled gold bracelet You won't be needing it anymore She'll be thrilled to pieces over this item and will reciprocate withlentils dates linseed oiland debens of copper
Go all the way back to the river shore area turn right just before you get to the donkey where you landed at Helipolis Talk to the first vendor you met Djaou Go down the list that appears tomandragore rootsand trade your linseed oil for them Trade the lentils forgarlic Djaou has no beer so ask him lastly about the fan tree leaves He does know where you might get some He needs your help for his bellyache though first
The recipe for the bellyache remedy will appear
You already have the bean flour juniper berries and carroway seeds All you need is the honey
Go back around the corner and down to the vendor stall just to the left as you reach the intersection Talk to Kauit Give her your dates in exchange for thewillow leavesyou need Then give her your debens of copper in exchange for excellent qualityolive oil
You still need honey though before you can make the remedy for Djaou's bellyache and find out where the fan tree leaves can be found Go left and then all the way back to the map at the end of the street to the Temple then through the great statues entry to the storehouse row in the back Find the selfish Irou right where you left him
Ask Irou for honey He has some but he wants it himself of course If you want it you'll have to give up the gold ring from Djehouty's house After you give Irou the ring turn around and you'll find thehoneyjar in the wall cabinet on your left nearest the door
Notice that you have TWO portions of honey
Go to the Beer House in the village and exchange one portion of honey for some beer
Go back to Djehouty's house inside to the main room where you found the ring etc Go straight through the door and straight forward to the corner
Look down to find a large cooking pot You should see a fist icon Put the following items in the pot bean flourcarroway seedsjuniper berrieshoney The pot will immediately produce the bottledRemedy for Djaou Remember he told you he was going to sequester himself in an inconspicuous place until you were able to cure him
Leave Djehouty's house Turn right and go seven clicks down the main street Turn left and go forward into the alley Turn left again to spy Djaou leaning against a wall holding his poor stomach Give him the remedy
He doesn't exactly have the fan leaves He does know the man who may have some though This Nubian man will be found at the House of Beer
Leave Djaou to recover and go back out to the main street Go back toward the shore and Djaou's stall But before the end of the row of buildings on the right turn and enter the House of Beer
After the ensuing cutscene you will see the Nubian again in the far left corner Go talk to him He wants you to have a beer with him The Nubian has a great time teasing you But he finally tells you that you'll need a trade permit from the Governor himself before he can provide you with a special product like fan tree leaves Chapter The Governor's Villa Off to the Governor's house you go Just take the same route as if you were going to the Temple and when the map appears click on the Governor's Villa CD After a brief cutscene you will find yourself inside the entrance to the Governor's Villa Before you go forward turn left and notice the alcove Turn right and note an entry to a garden area Go forward and ask the first man Paihry to see the Governor You'll have to get tough with him too He allows you to pass and approach a second guard When this one challenges you answer him with the first conversation choice You're a warrior aren't you
You look like a fine soldier to me
My whole life I've dreamed of meeting a warrior Listen my husband is in there My word is equal to the reputation of our country's soldiers When you tell him you will come to him later that night he will let you pass into the house You will be greeted by a musician who is seeking a missing drummer He won't let you in It looks like you'll need to find the missing drummer or at least the drum
Turn around and leave the way you came in Out on the steps go extreme left into the far garden entry Once inside turn right and walk all the way around the pool to the gazebo in the back You will find the intoxicated musician asleep on the gazebo floor In the corner behind her is herdrum
Take it and after a cutscene return to the house Go on inside and this time you will readily get past the chief musician in your disguise as the missing lady drummer
Go into the large central hall where the musician instructs you on how to play for the dancers
You must duplicate the rhythm of the drums by synchronizing your beats with the flashing lights in the drum If you do well the dancer to the left will join her dancing partner If not she will come out on the floor and then retreat toward the wall again
You must complete the drum puzzle correctly There is no solve for it
After the drum puzzle is solved go forward twice into the Great Hall Turn left and approach the Governor Nakht in the white tunic He agrees to talk to you later in a room at the back the bedroom
Leave the Governor and facing the back of the room where you see a simple throne arrangement exit through the door on the right side You will see the two dancers resting
Once outside on the veranda turn right and go talk to the guard in front of Nakht's bedroom door He will let you through when you insist Enter the bedroom Go forward and walk around the perimeter of the room On the ledge at the back of the room pick upHetep's reportabout the poisoned wheat
The Governor interrupts you in a cutscene and seems suspiciously disinterested in Hetep's report or in helping you by granting permission to buy the fan leaves for the remedy recipe You are subsequently ordered to drink a tainted brew brought in by the Theban priest Apparently the Governor has been remiss in his duties He just loves to party And partying and living the good life is very expensive
He's been blithely accepting money and goods from Theban making him indebted to Theban and stupidly completely within his power
During the cutscene you fall to the floor unconscious while Theban and Nahkt discuss what befell poor Hetep and what must be done next that is to hide Hetep's report Chapter The Abandoned Quarries You awake in the abandoned quarries Look down and around to see Hetep's broken body Pick up thepick axe
Turn left and go out through the lighted archway on the right Follow the tunnel around to the right until you come to a dead end with a pile of broken rocks
Turn right and find a square shaped impression in the wall to the left of a burning torch Use your pick axe on the square stone You will hear a rumbling sound like heavy stone moving
Put your pick axe away and walk back the way you came When you come around the corner go forward once and turn right Follow that new corridor into another quarry room Pick up the ladder you find there Use it on the large granite block at the end of the room to try to reach the sunlit opening in the roof The ladder is very old and it crumbles
Scan around to find that you have company an old friend or maybe your alter ego the black cat Approach the cat What is she doing scratching at the floor there
Maybe she is trying to tell you something Use your pick axe in the spot where the cat is scratching After the cutscene turn right and follow the sunlight out of the quarries
Use the map to go back to the Neighborhood Chapter Preparing the Remedy You can't go back to the Governor's house yet to find where he and Theban have hidden Hetep's grain report
When you arrive in the Neighborhood the Nubian will step out to greet you He tells you that Djehouty your adopted father has succumbed to the strange illness and has passed away How sad that Tifet could not find all the ingredients in time to save him
When you speak with the Nubian again he will tell you that there is someone waiting for you at Djehouty's house downstairs He also tells you that he will take care of Dehouty
Go inside the house through the courtyard In a cutscene you will view Djehouty's body on the sunroof Speak with the Nubian again near the outer wall He tells you that a dozen other people have also died of the disease The Nubian entreats you to leave town But you must stay to help The Nubian consents to help you and he tells you there's a bag containing fan leaves downstairs along with the someone who wants to see you
Turn around to see Ipouky sullenly slouching by the stairway door Talk to him He wants you to help Mi his friend who is apparently also ill from the poisoned wheat Go right on down the stairs behind Ipouky
Downstairs in the main room turn left and go to Mi who is sitting on the ledge near the corner Click on her Then Examine her You will see displayed the recipe for the remedy Exit the screen
Mi will be the first to receive the new medicine
Turn right and go to the opposite corner to find thefan leaveson the ledge near where you picked up Djehouty's writing equipment If you haven't already move further to the right and pick up thesleeping potionand thewheat grains
Cross to the big cauldron that you used to prepare the remedy for Djaou's bellyache Click on the pot to learn that this is where you will prepare the remedy for the much needed antidote
Remember you must use the ingredients in the correct order Preparing the Remedy add willow leaves to the pot
add mandragose mandrake root
add garlic
add olive oil
add fan tree leaves
add the beer The Beer Puzzle When you click to pour the beer in the cauldron Tifet will tell you to measure out the beer and you need doses of beer in one jar She will direct you if you have trouble figuring out how to get four doses in one jar There is no set solution for this puzzle so just keep pouring doses back and forth and listening to Tifet until you figure it out I found it easiest to isolate one dose in one of the two larger jars fill up the little three dose jar and then add it to the jar with one dose That appears to be the simplest solution
Following is a detailed solution for the Beer Puzzle recently submitted by J Wright of Gameboomers To be able to put units into different containers you would have to use the larger containers
I found a set of solution that might interest you A unit jar B unit jar C unit jar At the beginning you have this scenario

Turn right and go administer the remedy to little Mi In a cutscene you appear on the sunroof with the Nubian Ipouky and Mi
Walk forward once and speak again to the Nubian He tells you you should give the remedy to Meryre the Great Seer Turn around and walk over to speak to Mi who is all better completely healed Go to the stairway and click on a very grateful Ipouky before you go out to access the map and return once again to the Temple Chapter Reporting to the Great Seer At the Temple courtyard go to the far right entrance and speak with Kephren He allows you entry to the Library courtyard Go on left into the Schoool courtyard where you will find both Menna and the Great Seer
Give the remedy to the Great Seer He tells you he will have Heliopolis' doctors reproduce the formula and will issue new wheat to the community which has just arrived by ship He says he will do nothing about the Governor and Theban unless you bring proof of their misdeeds So you do need to get that report of Hetep's back wherever Nahkt and Theban have hidden it
With a last warning the Great Seer admonishes you to do what you think is right but you must break no laws
Leave the temple and go back to the village
You will meet the Nubian outside Djehouty's house
Talk to him
You will find yourself at the Governor's Villa Chapter The Cat Burglar's Finale Outside the Governor's house in the courtyard it is now very dark Swing left to see and hear Paihry the guard sleeping soundly in the alcove you checked out earlier Don't wake him Instead go to the right archway and into the garden Go left along the wall until you come to the second archway leading back to the courtyard See the geese visiting with one another there Seems a good idea to put these little honkers to rest for a while so they won't become alarmed and noisily interrupt your plans Combine the wheat grains with the sleeping potion in your inventory Click the mixture on the geese to put them to sleep Go through the entry and left around to the entrance of the house Go up the steps
Once inside continue forward three times until you are standing in the middle of the Great Hall and can see both right and left exits out onto the veranda in back When you see the guard on his rounds pass the right side doorway going left toward the other side wait about ten seconds to make sure the guard's back is to the Governor's bedroom
Then quietly go out onto the veranda turn right and quickly enter the Governor's bedroom
After the cutscene where you nearly blow your cover go to the cabinet on the wall to the left of the Governor's bed left of his feet Open the cabinet and move the statue Turn completely around
Go to and open the cabinet on the opposite wall TakeHetep's report Put it in your inventory Save your game Now go to the door Wait for the guard to walk the other direction Then go out turn left and enter the Great Hall
Continue on out into the courtyard where you will see that Paihry is awake and vigilantly guarding your exit Go through to the garden by the entry where the geese are sleeping Pan down on the other side of the little gate and pick up somegravelfrom the ground Throw the gravel at the geese to awaken them
Paihry will come over to check out their chatter As soon as you can turn left and run to the other garden exit Run across the courtyard to the alcove where you first found Paihry sleeping
Pan down and find thekey Turn around and run back into the garden by the same route Go down the right side of the pool two clicks Turn right and use the garden door to exit
A cutscene takes you out of the Villa where you access the map to go to the Temple again Go to the far left entry to the Silo Courtyard and go on in
You will see Meryre in conversation with two other men a warrior and a guard Click Hetep's report on Meryre's back You are delivering the final proof he required
He will turn to tell you that he will open an investigation He thinks you are a brilliant priestess
And he thanks you extravagantly for your heroism
Finally the Governor is banished from Heliopolis and the Theban priest's plans to conquer the city are forever thwarted
You Tifet have saved Helipolis Congratulations

Hence anyattempt to reproduceanythingfrom this walkthrough will beseverelypunished to themaximumextent of the law
Kindly address all your comments and questions toZSZUBAIRIE AOL com The Walkthrough GENERALLY This is a very easy and pleasant point and click game It is also what I would call a quot fair quot game I have played a lot of games where the developers introduce puzzles with quot counter intuitive quot solutions They don't seem to realize that the use of such quot techniques quot might make the puzzle hard but only because the quot solutions quot would never work in real life Thus instead of being fascinated by the developers' ingenuity the gamers are only aggravated by the trickery I am happy to tell you that The Egyptian Prophecy isnotsuch a game

The Third Door The Five Guards You must determine which of the five guards has the heart ofFeathers Imagine as if the five guards before you were numbered as follows
Note thatGuard No
is the smallest of the five Thus this is the quot small guard quot that the riddle tells us has the quot HEART OF STONE quot The clues also tell us The heart ofGOLDis to the RIGHT of the heart ofSTONE
TheLAPIS LAZULIheart is between the hearts ofSTONEandGOLD
ThePAPYRUSheart is to the right of the heart ofGOLD
Thus the hearts of gold lapis lazuli and papyrus are all to the right of the small guard with the heart of stone This takes care of all three guards to the right of the one with the heart of stone leaving only one guard unaccounted for Guard No
the one to theLEFTof the one with the heart of stone Hence Guard No
is the one with the Heart of Feathers
Additional Note Since thereareonly three guards to the right of the small guard Guard No
has the heart of Gold ndash because as the clues tell us the Lapis Lazuli heart comesbetweenthe hearts of stone and gold and the Papyrus heart is to therightof the heart of gold Thus Guard No
has the Lapis Lazuli heart andGuard No
has the Papyrus heart
So click onGuard No

Continue the training for as long as you like Then suspend the training turn off the last spell and step out of the Storehouse Courtyard Approach the Dreamer standing in the Temple entrance on your right A dialog follows Allow him to test you and interpret the parts of his dream as follows
quot The beginning of your dream indicates that in three summers the harvest will be particularly good quot quot You will lose your parents quot quot You will have the support of the gods and because of that you will rise above common folk quot quot You will live an honest life quot quot You will gain authority over people quot As the Dreamer steps aside try to go past him Another dialog will follow as he gives you aMagic Coffer Go past him and enter the Temple to find three workers inside You must reach the other end of the hall without attracting anyone's attention
Take a moment to study the patterns of the workers' movement The worker on your left is dozing on and off The two workers on your right are busy working at their respective pillars but each moves after a while to get something from his stuff further on your right You must wait for all three workers to look away from the central path before making your move i e for the worker on your left todoze off for the onein the front right to lean over his stuff and for theone in the back right to walk over to his stuff As soon as the three do this all at the same time take threeQUICKsteps forward Maya's comment will indicate that you made it Turn left and approach Tuya standing in front of the Naos to begin the final chapter

Note also that you will get very little time tochoose and then casta counter spell after Tuya has finished castingherspell on you So instead of giving you a list of long phrases to remember I have given some quot catch phrases quot from the spells she will use As soon as you hear those words check the list below for the correct counter spell That way you can bring out and cast that spell as soon as Tuya finishes casting hers Note Don't worry if you run out of time however because the puzzle will simply start over

Itmaymove into anunfortified neither red nor blue square sometimes either to gain some tactical advantage or to avoid being attacked
I have played this puzzle dozens of times now and Ineversaw it move into a blue Maya's fortified square
Mind the following in making your moves Be sure toFORTIFYa square right click to turn itblue before moving into it
DoNOTstep into any red squares because that means instant death
Avoidstepping into any one of thefivesquaresaround the snake's headwithout first fortifying it because the snake can immediately attack you there

GAME BOOMERS hints cheats and walkthroughs
This is not a complete walkthrough because many of the puzzles have multiple solutions or keep changing but that is some of the fun of this game
I do hope it gives some helpful hints
It is also not complete because I am stuck at the very last puzzle
First level To turn on the light you need to click on the moon and the half dark earth
The darkened point of the sun needs to be excactly oposite the dark part of the earth
Turn towards the acid pool and press the the second sun quarter from the right
Turn around and you should see a sun quarter in the lower left of the panel
The object of this puzzle is to change all the moons to suns and to leave the earth pieces on the bottom
As you click on a tile above the empty spot it slides down and changes
The moon pieces change to earth and the earth pieces change to suns
Keep moving the pieces around until you have suns on top and earth pieces on the bottom with the space on the lower left corner empty
The big sun on top should now sprout points and the door to the next room opens
Turn on the light in the next room the same way you did before
Turn right and solve the tile puzzle at the entrance to the next chamber
You need to follow the layout of the tiles exactly to avoid the trap
After every wrong attempt the sequence of the layout changes so that one time you have to follow it from the top left to right and the next time from the bottom right to left You are now in a big hall with double doors
Turn on the light
Turn right and solve the tile puzzle for the next chamber
Turn on the light in the next room
The puzzle in this room is a musical puzzle
Notice that when you press the top bar seven different notes are played in the right hand square
Next to the square are waves with seven different points
You are to repeat the sequence of the notes by clicking under the corresponding points of the wave
If you start out correctly and click on the top bar again the same sequence will play again
If you make a mistake however you will get a whole new sequence of notes
When you click on the shaft the notes of the waves will be played
Some sequences are obviously easier then others
I always wait until one starts at the very top or very bottom
Still it took me quite a while
If anyone has figured out the pattern please share it
When you have successfully played back the seven notes the puzzle repeats them
This opens the door to the next chamber
On the left of this room is a star puzzle
Click on the moon that turns the little stars above
Then click on each star on the bottom
Keep repeating this until a star jumps into the empty star shape on the left next to the big star
Now click on the moon and then on the big star
Keep repeating this until the first little star vacates its place
Follow the same procedure for the other stars until all of them are in position
You can now take the big star
Go back into the first room you need to solve the tile puzzle every time you go through a doorway and push in all the sun quaters on the acid pool
Go back into the room with the big sun and plug the missing piece into the middle
Then click on the points of the sun
Start at the till position and click on every th point counterclockwise
These points will then grow bigger
Go back into the big hall
Now there is a puzzle on the double doors
The object is to reverse the position of the sun and the moon
Keep klicking on the moons and the suns on the bottom
Once they have reversed their position the double doors will open
Level To make the rays of electricity visible throw the rock through the open doors
Wait until there is a break in electricity then enter quickly
Turn left and solve the puzzle with the two balls
Again you need to reverse the position of the two object
Keep playing with the buttons on the bottom the puzzle practically solves itself
Turn right and work the light switch
It basically functions the same way as the others except that you need to click on the right wave in order to turn on the light
Enter the chamber
Right in front of you is a big red circle with a bullseye underneath
Click on the upper part of the red circle and then on the bullseye
This opens the first room upstairs
Go upstairs and turn on the light
In the first room you need to make a raw crystal
Push the upper half of the buttons so that you get blocks
Then push the stamp button
Take the crystal go downstairs close the doors and open the second room by pushing on the middle of the red circle
Upstairs put your crystal in the machine and crush it by punching and the tongs button
Take the flattened crystal go downstairs and open the third room
Put your crystal in the hopper push and the fire button
If you make a mistake on this or the previous machine you will lose your crystal and have to go back to the first room to make a new one
Take your finished crystal to the acid pool where the star puzzle is to energize it
At the pool push the pointer on the very left
A walkway will appear
Go to the middle of the pool put the crystal in the square hole and take the pointer
With the pointer in hand push the lower left point by the crystal
The walkway will move into the oposite direction
Click on the square on the bottom to get it back and go back to the edge of the pool
Release the first pointer push in the second and return to the center
Again with the pointer push the next point
Repeat these steps until you have pushed all four points around the crystal
It will now be energized
Take the crystal and go back through the double doors Turn right and work the crystal prism puzzle
The object is to get the light from the left to the right
I did this completely by trial and error so I don iuml t know the pattern
Just notice which buttons on the bottom control which triangles and try not to turn some off that have already been lit
This opens the door to the next chamber
Turn on the light and take the empty torch on the wall next to the big hole
Put the torch next to your hand on the inventory screen and put the crystal on top
The two will combine and you have a working torch to enter the maze
Level The maze has five levels and a map is available for downloading in this library
Level The maze ends in the cathedral
Turn right and look at the machine with the ice block on top
The machine has six buttons Push then the button on the right
Take the key
Turn left to a similar machine and push and the button on the right
Take the glasses
Next to this machine is a pedestal with a glass block on top
Put the glasses next to your hand on the inventory screen and click on the glass case
Now click on the diary and you can read the conclusion of the adventure
Go to the altar and place the key on it
You need to click on the lights that appear on the carved portion of the altar
Be accurate and quick
After the top of the altar lights up take your key back and step back
You will be transported back into the hall of level
Make another crystal energize it at the pool as before and return to the cathedral by using the key on the altar in the hall
Go to the nuclear machine click on the middle door and put your crystal into it
Next to the nuclear machine is a rack with rods
Put on the gloves then insert each rod into the machine
Take the control rods out of the machine and put them on the rack
The machine should now be humming
Find the stellar clock and timer
On the timer you need to shift the pieces around until the correct picture forms
When you click on two pieces these two change places
Then make the connections on the stellar clock so it looks the same as the timer
When they are humming you are ready to go to sleep
Go up the steps behind the altar and enter a sarcophgus
Level After you get up you need to fashion four crystals for transportation
There are more machines that have buttons each

Starting with the machine all the way to the right of the altar the sequence for the different machines is Then go to the moat opposite the altar
The crystals will be there
You now need to transport them forward in the right sequence and I have not figured out how to do this
So if you figure it out before I do please let me know
Final Solution submitted by Allen RhodusWhen you click on one it goes to a place on the raft starting at the left the first crystal one can be transferred with the the third put them on the raft and leave one or the other there and come back with the other Click the one on the raft and take it off then send the one second from the left on the raft with the one on the far right
Send them across put both of them in the temple now take the first crystal you moved to the raft and moveback to where the last crystal is load it on and go across After putting the crystals in the temple theres one last puzzle the crystal thats the uppermost left corner is one and the upper right is three and so on Hit then the big crystal at the top should change colors then youre done and the game ends until the sequel GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
WALKTHROUGH LAYOUT This walkthrough is laid out by location as opposed to objectives
If you get stuck or want to see if you missed anything you can simply look up the location
For most locations the objective is in parenthesis right after the name
You can also use the walkthrough to tell you where to go next although I avoid doing that because it spoils the fun of what little exploring there is
You do not have to do everything in the order presented here but I think this is the most efficient sequence
There are not very many details on how to do most things though
That remains for you to figure out
REVIEW I initially found this game frustrating annoying and tedious
If it had not been for the walkthroughs from GameBoomers com I wouldn't have even bothered to finish it
Once I had the walkthroughs it was no longer frustrating and annoying
It just got boring quickly
I could play it for about an hour before I got bored talking to most of the characters and figuring things out on my own before looking at a walkthrough
The game is sort of like an interactive Saturday morning cartoon
In fact the videos reminded me of those cartoons almost every time
I'm not a big cartoon fan
The games I like are the Tomb Raider series and Myst series
In both there is a lot of exploring and very little contact with other characters
The necessary objects are pretty much right out in the open it is obvious when one has been found and it is easy to figure out which item to use next
Both games are very intuitive
Tomb Raider is in fact rather linear in sequence and the necessary object to use comes up automatically
Tomb Raider adds some enjoyable but not too complex puzzles and some foes to fight for action
Myst is not as linear and adds more complex puzzles some too complex for me but there is plenty of exploring and there is always help available when I get stuck
Monkey Island on the other hand is all about talking to characters with very little exploring
In fact the talking is the main component of the puzzles and the game
In addition more than half the talking is meaningless and has nothing to do with solving the game
Some of the solutions are not intuitive at all and there are hidden trigger questions
If you fail to ask a character the right question the next segment won't be active
In one case I failed to go the right direction and the game locked up
I had to look that up in a walkthrough
To sum it up if you like Tomb Raider and Myst in the way I do and are not a big cartoon fan you probably won't like Escape from Monkey Island
But Escape is tolerable

END When you have all three parts a long video will take you back to Melee Island and then to Monkey Island for Act Back to the top ACT Escape from Monkey Island MONKEY ISLAND escape SHORE Notice the bananas overhead
CLUTTERED CLEARING You don't need to deal with Herman Toothrot yet
CANYON MINE Pick up the banana picker on the right side
BEACH get the bananas and get the monkey to follow Use the banana picker to pick ALL the bananas Give a banana to Timmy the monkey Keep using them to get him to follow you to the canyon

LAVA FIELD get the bottle and cut the weeds Steer the boat towards the bottle and use the banana picker to get it Steer towards the pool by the rock you threw earlier Use the weed whipper on the weeds Go to the monkey village next or the game might lock up
MONKEY VILLAGE get the accordion and learn about monkey kombat Talk to JoJo Jr about monkey kombat Use the shields cymbals on the musical monkey Pick up the accordion On the way back to the beach you will have to kick over the palm tree
CLUTTERED CLEARING get the gubernatorial seal Pick up the coconut You have to hit Herman Toothrot with three items
I don't know if you have to talk to him after each item but you will at the end
Hit Herman with the coconut the bottle and the accordion Talk to him until you get the second gubernatorial seal
FOREST AROUND MONKEY VILLAGE learn monkey kombat There is a monkey wandering around in map mode
When you encounter him you can play monkey kombat with him to learn the moves
Actually there are several monkeys and you have to beat each one to get enough points otherwise JoJo won't fight you The moves are apparently different in every game so write yours down
I suggest using the pause key to freeze the screen and recording the moves in the tables below as I did
You have to record both the trigger phrases and which stance beats which
Once you have them you can look up which stance will beat the monkey and how to activate it from your stance
Table SAMPLE which stance wins Table SAMPLE which stance wins Gimpy DrunkenChargingBobbingAnxiousGimpy duplicateduplicateduplicateduplicateDrunkenGimpy duplicateduplicateduplicateChargingChargingDrunken duplicateduplicateBobbingGimpyBobbingBobbing duplicateAnxiousAnxiousDrunkenChargingAnxious Table SAMPLE stance change codes Gimpy DrunkenChargingBobbingAnxiousGimpy duplicateduplicateduplicateduplicateDrunkenAEO duplicateduplicateduplicateChargingCAOACO duplicateduplicateBobbingAOEOAEEAO duplicateAnxiousAOCOACAECACE Table YOUR which stance wins Gimpy DrunkenChargingBobbingAnxiousGimpy duplicateduplicateduplicateduplicateDrunken duplicateduplicateduplicateCharging duplicateduplicateBobbing duplicateAnxious Table YOUR stance change codes Gimpy DrunkenChargingBobbingAnxiousGimpy duplicateduplicateduplicateduplicateDrunken duplicateduplicateduplicateCharging duplicateduplicateBobbing duplicateAnxious MONKEY VILLAGE Challenge and beat Jojo to get the hat
GIANT MONKEY HEAD activate the giant monkey robot Use the bronze hat with the giant head
It will end up on top Use the banana picker on the nose and go inside Use the gubernatorial seal on the prominent slot inside the control room You should get a video taking you to Act
Back to the top ACT Guybrush Kicks Unusually Large Butt GIANT TOWER ISLAND flip the switch on the conch shell Pick up the large plank and use it on the small tower Climb the small tower Jump on the plank Flip the switch
ULTIMATE MINKEY COMBAT This is counterintuitive
To win you have to get a DRAW three times in a row
In other words match LeChuck's move instead of beating him
END As near as I can tell you get the same result no matter which phrase you choose kind of dumb and disappointing

LAST DITCH MONKEY KOMBAT INSTRUCTIONS by Nancy Griffin burpee Have you given up Are you frustrated and want to break your Monkey Island CD into itty bitty shards of plastic Has Monkey Kombat caused you to pull out your hair when you are so close to the end Well fret no more the following instructions will hopefully be the undoing of Monkey Kombat rsquo s secrets
Important things to keep in mind This is going to be confusing but that rsquo s why you are here isn rsquo t it Read these instructions more than once and try some of the suggestions while practicing Monkey Kombat is a learned art
You learn the information needed to win by practicing
You will have to practice There is no way around it
There are different monkey stances Each stance beats other stances
To change from one stance to another you must utter different monkey sounds from a possible sounds
Eek down arrow E You learn the sounds needed by copying what sounds are made by the monkey you are fighting with during practice
When you have a DRAW no one wins the monkey stance for you and the monkey will change to a new stance
The sounds needed to change from one stance to another is the same changing from either direction Example If you want to change from Anxious Ape to Bobbing Baboon and the sounds are ACK OOP CHEE you can also change from Bobbing Baboon to Anxious Ape by saying ACK OOP CHEE the same sounds
If you get a FOUL you have used a set of sounds that don rsquo t work with the monkey stance you are in Let rsquo s say that you are Charging Chimp
Here aresampleCharging Chimp change codes
Charging Chimp to Gimpy Gibbon ack chee eek To stay Charging Chimp hit any same sounds ack ack ack or chee chee chee etc This works for any stance you are in
Also remember that these same codes work backwards If you are Anxious Ape and want to be Charging Chimp you would use chee eek oop the same as for Charging Chimp to Anxious Ape
OK now if you used oop chee eek you would get a FOUL as it is not a Charging Chimp code
The code sounds I am using are for my game It is possible that your game uses the same codes Wouldn rsquo t that be niceJ While practice fighting use the spacebar to pause the game and write down the needed information Let rsquo s say you just started your first practice fight
You both are Anxious Ape and the monkey goes first He utters chee eek oop and you hit the spacebar to pause the game Write this down AA for Anxious Ape to CEO chee eek oop Hit the spacebar again to unpause the game The monkey rsquo s stance changes from AA to Charging Chimp CC Hit the spacebar to pause the game again and fill in the blank with CC Charging Chimp
AA to CC CEO anxious ape to charging chimp type in chee eek oop You also now know that CC to AA CEO remember
After the monkey changes from Anxious Ape to Charging Chimp you will get zapped and lose a banana This is what happened in my game but you may have different codes and what beats what in your game You must record what happened
Write this down Anxious Ape beats Bobbing Baboon beats Charging Chimp beats Drunken Monkey beats Gimpy Gibbon beats You can now write in that Charging chimp beats Anxious Ape My filled in stance record looked like this AA beats BB and GG BB beats CC and DM CC beats AA and GG DM beats AA and CC GG beats BB and DM You need to fight Timid monkey smelly monkey and brawny monkey in practice fights to gain all the information that you need to beat JoJoJr
Memorize everything you rsquo ve just read
Let rsquo s do a practice fight You start with Timid monkey and you both are probably Anxious Ape The monkey will probably go first during early practice rounds He utters chee eek oop and becomes Charging chimp
You lose a banana
Write down ldquo CC beats AA rdquo and also ldquo to change from AA to CC and CC to AA say chee eek oop ceo rdquo
You don rsquo t know any codes yet so you say chee eek oop and also become Charging Chimp You have a DRAW and no one loses a banana You both now become Bobbing Baboon and the monkey goes first He utters ack oop chee and becomes Anxious Ape You lose a banana
Write down ldquo AA beats BB rdquo and also ldquo to change from BB to AA and AA to BB say AOC ack oop chee rdquo
You still don rsquo t know enough codes and stances to defend yourself so you just say ack oop chee and become Anxious Ape as well Draw again
The monkey says eek eek eek and he stays Anxious Ape remember Another draw and no one loses a banana Now you have the upper hand You are a brilliant deductionist and know from the very first move that Charging Chimp beats Anxious Ape so you say ldquo chee eek oop rdquo You have become Charging Chimp and zap your opponent You unfortunately will lose a couple of times Use the spacebar Take your time figuring out what beats what while paused and then zap him
When you finally beat him you need to move on to the next monkey That would be Smelly Monkey You will learn new codes and what beats what for different stances You may learn the Gimpy Gibbon code to become Charging Chimp and or that Drunken Monkey beats Anxious Ape
Record every new thing you learn You will eventually move on to Brawny Monkey and learn the last codes needed to beat JoJo Jr Don rsquo t worry JoJo is easy He flubs at the end You just need to know your codes and what beats what It rsquo s possible that you will have the same set of codes and what beats what so I rsquo m listing what I recorded while learning to fight Monkey Kombat Everything is abbreviated
STANCES ndash what beats what AA beats BB and GG BB beats CC and DM CC beats AA and GG DM beats AA and CC GG beats BB and DM CODES ndash changing sound codes CC to AA CEO AA to CC CC to BB OAE BB to CC CC to DM AEC DM to CC CC to GG ACE GG to CC AA to BB AOC BB to AA AA to DM EOA DM to AA AA to GG
never got it never needed it BB to DM ACO DM to BB BB to GG OCE GG to BB DM to GG AEO GG to DM I hope that this makes just enough sense to help you understand the information needed to compete and win at Monkey Kombat It looks like a lot of information but really it is just hard to explain not hard to execute
Good luck and have fun

The Main Menu allows you to select New Game Continue Save Game Load Game Settings Credits Exit the Game and Fiona rsquo s Notes a commentary and hint feature
During gameplay pressing the ldquo Esc rdquo key brings up the Main Menu
The game contains four difficulty levels allowing you to choose the frequency of selected hints
Helpful keyboard functions include ldquo H rdquo shows all hotspots ldquo G rdquo shows items only ldquo E rdquo shows exits only and F Fiona rsquo s Notes
Double clicking on exits or on the locations on the map indicated by a ldquo door rdquo icon will take you straight to the next location without the ldquo getting there rdquo animation
Moving the cursor down to the bottom of the screen brings up an inventory bar ndash this includes inventory items small arrows for scrolling through the inventory screens a map icon and a short way into the gameplay an icon for changing between nighttime and daytime
Items can be combined in inventory by clicking on one item which will attach itself to the cursor and then clicking on the second item
To use inventory items in the game environment click on the item and then click on the person or object with which you wish to use the item
Right clicking on items in inventory gives more information about them
Dialogs can be clicked through using the left mouse button
Occasionally during conversations with the various characters you may find a line of subtitle text left over at the bottom of the screen
Simply click on the screen to finish the conversation
Sometimes progress in the game is triggered by something said during a conversation with a character in the game
So if you are stuck it might help to go back and talk to all the characters exhausting all dialog options in both daytime and nighttime
During gameplay you may see a book icon that suddenly appears at the top right of the screen flashes on and off and then disappears
This is a signal that new information is available in Fiona rsquo s Notes accessed by pressing the F key
Fiona rsquo s Notes contain some general information and also can help steer you in the right direction if you are feeling lost
The Notes also contain a Hint system ndash you can access three hints per gameplay challenge by clicking on each of the three candle flames
If you click on ldquo Completed Tasks rdquo from time to time you rsquo ll find comments in blue by Fiona
If you wish to play the game mostly on your own and only refer to this walkthrough occasionally the following hint might be helpful ndash as each new chapter begins a few things will most likely have changed within the game environments so searching interiors and exteriors in both daytime and nighttime ndash as well as talking to the characters again will be worth your while
Everlightis somewhat nonlinear and although some of the tasks must be accomplished during specific chapters others can be started and or completed in more than one chapter
If you are playing the game largely on your own and are looking for a hint you may find the description of that particular challenge in an earlier or later chapter of this walkthrough
I have noted the original location of the inventory items as well as whether they were discovered during nighttime or daytime as described in the walkthrough ndash you may discover on your own that certain of the items are available in their original locations both in daytime and during the nighttime
Note short paragraphs in italics beginning with the word ldquo note rdquo will discuss various themes within the game
Reading these notes is not necessary in order to progress and can be skipped if you desire
Skip the notes if you don rsquo t enjoy plot foreshadowing and inferences that may work together to become slight plot spoilers
Also skip the notes if you rsquo d prefer to enjoy Everlight rsquo s high fantasy environment without thinking about the more serious issues hinted at in the game

Still this was not as neat a solution as the cat in the library
Another way to succeed use drastic measures when necessary
Meeting the Town Councilors Use the map and go to the Town Hall Square

Talk to Fiona about all of these things
Sneezing Powder Talk to Hocus
By night he is a prankster
He has sneezing powder which he will only give to Melvin if Melvin can come up with something really funny to do with the powder
Tell Hocus that you would use the powder on Valerius putting it in his pants as he sat at the fireplace all day and causing him to crawl about in the dirt
Hocus gives Melvin the powder

Talk to Steve if you can catch up to him

Use all the dialog choices about the statuette under the terrarium
Farida must have acquired it during the night but she has no memory of how she acquired it
Talk to Farida about Walt rsquo s accusation
Melvin has no money so Farida takes back all the stuff he just pocketed except for the magic slow drying ink which only can be made visible with the powder in Farida rsquo s shop that Melvin can rsquo t afford to buy
Life is very cruel
Melvin automatically leaves the shop
Farida is painting the shop rsquo s exterior
Talk to her again

Talk to Farida about going to see Kalas
You rsquo ll automatically be back at the Hermit rsquo s Cave
Melvin puts powder on Farida and Kalas rsquo s hands ndash both used the playing cards the previous night
They argue about the statuette and part as enemies
Note so far Melvin is a failure when it comes to patching up old quarrels among the residents of Tallen
But at least he now knows why Walt rsquo s house has been attacked at night
Solution for the Magic Bullets Mystery Caught in the Crossfire Farida has been shooting magic bullets at Kalas rsquo cave at night because of their quarrel over the statuette and Kalas rsquo repeated attempts to steal it back
Farida rsquo s magic bullets have been falling short and hitting Walt rsquo s house instead
How can Melvin stop the shooting war before someone gets hurt
Getting the Statuette Officially Fooling Farida Talk to Fiona about what you don rsquo t understand
Fiona says there must be an official way to get Farida to turn the statuette back over to Kalas so that Kalas doesn rsquo t continue to try to steal it prompting Farida to shoot magic bullets in the direction of his cave
But Melvin will need an official document and a uniform to accomplish this
Stripping the Scare guard of his Uniform Use the map to go to the Town Gate where you know there rsquo s a Scare guard with a useable uniform

Click on the door to Farida rsquo s Magic Shoppe
Fiona gives Melvin advice ndash Farida will be tricky
Melvin should stand up to her and not be submissive
Melvin needs to convince Farida that giving the statuette back to Kalas is really Farida rsquo s idea
Answering Farida rsquo s Questions Click on Farida to talk to her
If you fail to give the correct answers responses Melvin ends up back on the street where he will sometimes receive further advice from Fiona
He can then try again by trying out different responses
The correct answers to the eleven questions are Question One I rsquo m the new guy from the town guard
Question Two I rsquo m here to confiscate banned magic symbols Question Three An Anubis head
Question Four I have the official document with Adamus rsquo signature
Question Five We rsquo re talking about the safety of the town
Question Six The councilors think that the curse has something to do with a death cult
That makes the Anubis so suspect
Question Seven Hocus found a hint in some old writings that makes him believe that there is a connection between jackals and cursed towns
Now they want to examine it more precisely Question Eight Hocus as an expert for Anubis magic surely knows quite well what he does
At least he found the first useful hint as to the reason for the curse
Question Nine If I got that right the curse is related to old bewitched artifacts that have jackal heads on them
Therefore all objects with this symbol are confiscated for safety rsquo s sake
Question Ten I guess we can restrict ourselves to highly magical objects
Some cheap Anubis head magic surely won rsquo t cause a curse
Question Eleven I could restrict myself to symbols that are suspicious of causing bad magic
Can you think of anything like that
Returning the Statuette Farida gives the statuette to Melvin who walks outside with it
Fiona compliments him a first I think and then Melvin automatically discards the guard rsquo s costume in the alley
Click on the map to go to the Hermit rsquo s cave and click on the statuette in inventory that Melvin just received in Farida rsquo s shop then click on Kalas
Note Melvin overcomes his fear of failure improvises well and shows how persuasive he can be while engaging in battle of wits with a wily antagonist

The Councilors Agree ndash Melvin Should Break the Curse The conversation with the councilors continues
The councilors note that Melvin is not changed by the curse and is the only one who can travel back between daytime and nighttime while remaining unaffected
They want to appoint him as their official designee to figure out how to end the curse
Note the events that just unfolded were a sort of warm up for Melvin rsquo s mystery and problem solving abilities
For the rest of the game he rsquo ll be doing everything he can to figure out what rsquo s causing the curse ndash but this won rsquo t be easy
The task is complex enough to begin with but Melvin will also encounter opposition and distractions along the way
History Lessons and a Beautiful Blonde Background Information Talk to each of the councilors in turn ndash you may be able to talk to each twice
Valerius the ldquo head rdquo councilor is clueless when it comes to knowledge of history and about magic ndash he seems to be all form and no substance
Hoscus is the most adept magician among the councilors
He mentions that some curses are triggered by events the town rsquo s curse is probably of that type
Not everyone in town is magical ndash in fact there are fewer and fewer magicians around
Adamus is in charge of the town rsquo s finances
He seems to be the ldquo power behind the throne rdquo in terms of getting anything practical done
He says that Jeronimo used to be town historian and may know more about the Founders
There rsquo s a magic resin in the trees around Tallen that is the source of the town rsquo s wealth and some of its magic
Town Founders and Magic Creatures The town was founded by four magicians who consulted an oracle regarding the town rsquo s best location
Until the current curse Tallen has been remarkably free of disastrous natural events
It rsquo s almost as though the town has been magically protected
Ask Fiona about magic this world and impudence
The forest in addition to its magic resin also used to house many magic creatures
There may still be a few left
Meeting Laura Exit the Town Hall
A beautiful blonde
Talk to Laura
She is Councilor Valerius rsquo granddaughter and is staying in Tallen for a few weeks

He tries to do a magic illusion but it isn rsquo t as impressive as he expects
He says that more information can be found at the town library
Note Is the curse draining magic from the town the townspeople and the forest around the town
Or has the reduction in magic been going on for a very long time

Melvin can rsquo t find out more information about the town rsquo s past because he isn rsquo t authorized to look through the documents
Jonas can rsquo t break the ldquo authorized persons only rdquo rule while Jorog is in the library listening to everything that is said and done
Getting Jorog to Leave the Library Apparently Jorog wants to keep Melvin from finding out more about the town rsquo s history
The town rsquo s janitor has plunked himself down in the library where the best information is located and seems content to stay there indefinitely unless there rsquo s a much more interesting distraction
Maybe sensational news would get him to budge
Something of interest in the only other newspaper Melvin knows about ndash the one wrapped around the fish in the inn
Hot News Go to the Town Gate and talk to Waldo who is upset about the scare guard rsquo s missing uniform

Click to enter the library and talk to Jonas
He gives Melvin documents that can rsquo t leave the library
Right click in inventory to read the documents
The town site was selected by three magicians Valerian Pocus and Adamian but there is an indication of a fourth founder who may have been written out of the record
Perhaps the curse is related to that fourth founder

Why Don rsquo t You Speak for Yourself Melvin Walk to the main road and go to the mail post shack next to the manufactory
Click on the letter in inventory the letter rsquo s original location Laura in the Town Square daytime and click on Steve
He is on strike and so he won rsquo t mail the letter

Ask him about rumors and learn about the tunnel that leads out of the dungeon
Walk up the hill and talk to Walt
Walt leaves for the manufactory

A rat wearing a little chef rsquo s hat comes up through a hole in the floor and slides the floor tile out of the way revealing the secret passage tunnel
Go down the now revealed secret passage tunnel Melvin and Fiona wander about in the dark
Note It rsquo s strange that Fiona rsquo s ldquo sparkly rdquo quality isn rsquo t operating here where it would be extremely helpful
Perhaps she wants Melvin to show that he can overcome a fear of the dark as well as fear of everything else on the list
Learning the Magic Capsules Balls Manufacturing Process Melvin comes up through the floor and finds himself in the manufactory alone
Take the key near the door

Use the poster to identify the parts of the machine holding down the ldquo H rdquo key on your keyboard will help you identify the names of the parts Number seems to the trap door with a capsule going in
Number seems to be the cartridge holder with the cartridge currently missing
Number is the funnel with varnish being poured in
There rsquo s a varnish pressure gauge it has a curved arrow over it on the poster
Number is the chute for the capsules to exit into the box for capsules
Talk to Fiona ndash Melvin needs to set up as a competitor to Walt

Melvin asks about magic resin and magic varnish
Farida wants the statuette back and in exchange she may be willing to make the magic resin available
Farida also says that magic varnish can be acquired by combining the flowering night herb with the daylight flower
Note this means that Melvin must somehow steal from or trick Kalas and probably in such a way that Kalas doesn rsquo t have the ability to try to steal the statue back at night which would trigger the magic bullet war again

Evidence The Last Ritual ndash Walkthrough Part One English Version Not having played Missing Since January by Inferno Just got another email from the Phoenix says he rsquo s found me oooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhHmmm wonder if he's cute hellip The premise is that The Phoenix a psychotic serial killer has created this DVD which is a group of videos taken by the Phoenix from two very different people who though are on different sides of the world will become intertwined with the Phoenix as the catalyst
The police have received it and are trying to decrypt it so that they can see the videos on the DVD and use it to catch The Phoenix
They send it to the ICPA or International Committee for the Phoenix Arrest of which you will be invited to join as the game progresses for analysis
You get a copy of it for your system The game itself comes in an official ldquo evidence bag rdquo along with ldquo other investigators rdquo from this organization hence the different and various virtual emails that you will receive
INDEX General Notes and Introduction Email Internet Research Interface Walkthrough General Notes and Introduction This is a puzzle game with a very strong story
This is also a game of observation and deduction
It is an quot Expert quot Level game make no mistake
It will require logical and deductive research on the Internet while ldquo in game rdquo playing and yes you can keep your antivirus on while playing this game You will require Macromedia Flash player and Shockwave player Java runtime apps and QuickTime or for the game and websites to work correctly
You must have your ldquo popup blocker rdquo turned off while you play this game
You should be connected to the Internet with you email open before you install the game to avoid most problems of setup This is a mouse driven game which utilizes some keyboard strokes occasionally
Emails are a very big part of this game as most of the clues are located there
There is no save function the game saves for you automatically you can quot save quot manually at various gates and Levels but this is not for someone who not computer savvy The story is told between the puzzles and brainteasers that you must decipher and the videos that you will see
It is truly a fascinating experience often frustrating and highly rewarding as you progress
But the content and graphic can be disturbing for some
This is a story that will send you straight into the mind of a very dangerous psychopathic serial killer
This game is a game of thought intensive Internet research massive amounts of email second guessing the mind of an absolute loony and acute observation
That said this game is very non linear
It should also be noted that this game is based on levels within these levels there are quot gates' or quot doors quot distributed unevenly among these quot levels quot Each level may be approached in any combination ndash however here is the most logical progression And by the way Ever wonder how the Phoenix came up with those names
Have a look here http www voynich com enigma fig pdf Email Straight out of the gate you must set up your email and login Some gamers have told me that they we lsquo re having major problems with this so have a look at how I did it using an online web based email program
While my default email is not AOL I found that using the ldquo free rdquo email account option and setting up a free account proved to be the best ndash for once it is setup and opened while you are playing this email program will ldquo sound rdquo every time you get a new email
Before you do anything else make sure that you are connected to the Internet and have already opened up a ldquo web based rdquo email program
An example here would be ldquo hotmail com rdquo or ldquo AOL com rdquo For the purposes of this walkthrough we rsquo ll be using aol com as an example
So here we go Open your Internet browser and go to your email from there ndash AOL users would go tohttp www aol com
Hotmail users would go tohttp www msn com Earthlink users would go tohttp www earthlink net and sign into ldquo webmail rdquo and so on Sign in with your normal email or create a new email for this game
Leave your email program open If you have ldquo AutoPlay rdquo disabled enable it now
Now put the Evidence The Last Ritual DVD into your DVDROM or CD into your CD ROM as the case may be in your tower
The Game will start up and press Setup Click ok
Choose Standard Setup and let it load
Answer first question Yes or No depending upon if you played the first game Missing In Memoriam I chose ldquo No rdquo as I didn rsquo t play the first game
Click on quot On the Internet quot and then Click on Confirm
Create a login Name do not use spaces Use any name you like for this but choose one that you will remember
Type in the email address that you already have opened in your browser make sure that it is not longer than characters
Click on Register
The Evidence game program will tell you that quot a password has been sent to you via your email quot
Click on quot Open my email program quot
The browser should open to your already opened web based email and the email hopefully will be there
Click on quot Register quot
Once this is done you receive a welcoming email from ICPA giving you a password that you will use this every time you quot log in quot to the game
I wonder if the FBI does this
During the progress of this game you will receive many emails over from different characters
They are ICPA This is an organization dedicated to the capture of the Phoenix
The letters stand for The International Committee for the Phoenix Arrest
Headed up by Steeve Webbing Yes that is how he spells his name
Kristen Massenet ndash aliasKristin Lark She will become a colleague and a big help of yours shortly
Gery Millander Another colleague from ICPA
Gery is a computer technician
David Marcus ndash Also an ICPA member
David is a profiler
Cliff Alias hieronymus ICPA Volunteer
Goran Bates ndash a supposed friend of Gery rsquo s Dr Theo Makers ndash A professor of history specializing in the Middle Ages
His input is crucial
David Marcus ndash An ICPA profiler
Manuela Oritz ndash A young detective from Andalucia Spain
Gerd Hanke An ICPA investigator tracking the Phoenix in the field
You will also receive emails from two others but I rsquo ll leave that to you to find out who they are The emails are really hints they seem to come pretty close or right after you've found a solution or when you are stuck
It is important to save and reread these emails from time to time you will need them I promise you
They stop once you've deleted your profile from both the game 's interface and from the ldquo pheonix org rdquo site as well
Internet Research I found that Google was the best site to use for Evidence and all of my searches are based on that search engine
It is very important to note that you must type your searches in exactly as provided to obtain a quick result
As many of the web sites you will need to research will not be in English Remember to understand how to use an online translation program I use Babel Fish for most European languages and ldquo Stars rdquo for ancient languages
You will need both
I strongly suggest that you create a special folder in your ldquo Favorites rdquo or ldquo Bookmark rdquo section of your browser and save all of your searches each time you find some useful ldquo evidence rdquo ndash you more than likely will be reviewing those same sites more than once
You do have to disable your pop ups for some of the web sites that your searches will undoubtedly take you to but the game allows you to keep your anti virus program running
Now a note here about the ICPA web site hellip It wasn't until I received the fourth email from ICPA that I was granted an invitation to join the team by email and a website link
So don rsquo t panic if you don rsquo t get your invite on the first email
Once you register there you can see the news of how other team members are progressing invite them to participate with you store notes on the game write articles if you wish access translation programs search functions and read News flashes which are actual hints for the puzzles
An interesting point here is that if you find either a solution during the actual DVD game play or succeed to the next level there are eight and then open up this web site you will see a scrolling marquee at the top of the Webpage
This area will testify to your success for all to see
Interface The interface has no manual save system
All saves are automatic and once you start down this road there is no going back to a previous level
So ndash make sure you take copious notes
You may exit the game by either hitting the ESC key or ndash once the ldquo tool bar rdquo has been in installed clicking on the far right ldquo X rdquo will also give you the choice to either exit or cancel and continue with the game
You will be accessing both the Internet and your email during the game session through a ldquo Tool Bar rdquo
ndash The emails from Gery Millander and ICPA will advise you of links to certain downloads that will ldquo update rdquo this tool bar by adding various tools to help in your investigations
If you lose your emails or if you are experiencing difficulty with installing these tools simply go into your game at the top left of the screen
Click on the small gray rectangle to bring up your quot Tool Bar quot
When the Tool Bar is active Click on it in an quot empty section quot and type in the access code for the Tool that you need
You will only have to do this once but you must wait until you have the Tool Bar in order to use the access codes
Investigative Tools from Gery Millander These are severe spoilers run your mouse over them to read it ZOOM Tool with TEXT decoder access code JZ PNG Image Analyzer access code HY TRACER access code TS Update to Movie Tool Bar VIDEO DECRYPTING KEY ndash JA ROOTKIT XM There are cheat codes as well to complete a puzzle or review a movie clip but I rsquo ve been asked not to release them yet
Besides all the information you need is here
So quit your whining
There are doors or gates distributed throughout levels
You must open each of these in order to view a video clip and progress through the various levels
Once inside a level you may choose which ever puzzle you like however be careful here this game while very non linear can trip you up by doing so ndash and add to your frustration
The lay out for choosing which puzzle to work on first is outlined here within this walkthrough and represents the most logical path for you to take
If at anytime you wish to exit out of a puzzle and choose another returning to the beginning of a Level simply look at the bottom center of the screen there you will find the name of the door or gate that you are trying to access
If you click on it it will send you back to the start of the level that you are in Want to know where your saved games are stored
They rsquo re in your ldquo My Documents rdquo folder under ldquo im lastritual rdquo
Your password is stored there as well
The game is comprised of ten sections Introduction and Training level or CHALLENGE LEVEL LEVEL LEVEL LEVEL LEVEL LEVEL LEVEL LEVEL ENDGAME I have booked marked these to make it easier for you to search the walkthrough for just what you need
Along the way you are introduced to two stories which will intertwine later on as the game plays out
One story include various players in which are from quot Missing quot I believe Jack Lorski his cameraman Frederick and Gerd Hanke the police team from Spain who are trying to connect three grisly murders to the Phoenix
The other is about Jessica Moses and her friend Sharon Berti who are trying to uncover the whereabouts of Jessica's brother Adrian Moses who disappeared two years before somewhere along the East Coast of the US
They are independently investigating and recording their findings by each making a film documentary Main Strategy Throughout this game it is very important to use the keywords presented in both the movie clips and what the Phoenix tells you during the game in a search engine
The movie clips will give you clues to puzzles and which web sites you may need to search hellip keep your eyes peeled Puzzles themselves will give you clues sometimes hidden and sometimes overt overlook nothing
The Phoenix will say something to you at the beginning of each door and then again when you have completed any puzzle or completed parts of any puzzle ndash look carefully at what he says the clues are there for you interpret
Make diligent notes of what happens in the game and whom it happens to the victims for example
Mind the esoteric values of the killer rsquo s mind for it will help you get through the endgame
Remember that each solution means something hellip whether it is a running number a date a distance or a postal code
Whether it is a name word phrase or anagram it all means something to the Phoenix Some of the brain teasers in this game will require you to either enter the answers into the text boxes provided some will require that you click on the dashes to set letters and or numbers as the case may be
Still others will require you to ldquo catch rdquo or ldquo pull rdquo letters into their proper places Another general aspect of this game Check you Phoenix Organization site after you've completed a puzzle You'll see that your name will be at the top stating that you've been successful
Also make sure that you keep your email open while you are playing
Many hints are given in the emails that you receive
One more thing ndash in the upper right hand corner of the screen there is a small square with a question mark inside of it
Click on it at any time and The Phoenix will repeat his ldquo clues rdquo
Sometimes he will give you a little more each time you click
Remember to check your emails as you contemplate and work on the puzzles

The Experiment Experience Experiment Walkthrough by ronrob amp Becky Updated May Introduction The opening scenes indicate that you are on an old dilapidated ship that is grounded
Who you are and how you got there is not clear
You do seem to have access to some security cameras and the game begins with your finding Lea
Chemical Ecology Lab Upper Deck UD You see Lea lying on a cot
She awakes and tosses aside the IV tube
Lea finds a note on the table Lea if you're reading this letter it means you've survived a terrible event everything destroyed Lea thinks that the note was written by someone named John
Lea spots the security camera taps it to see whether it is working and then hears a noise outside
When she returns she asks whether she can trust you and gives you the code for activating the security system
In the code box type EDEHN and Enter
Note These code boxes will be needed often
Whenever they appear type the needed code and press Enter
Case is not important
Sometimes you rsquo ll need to click once on the small white horizontal portion within the box before the game will let you enter the code
Now Lea teaches you a little about the camera functions
She asks you to click Cameras on the menu
Note The main menu can be displayed at any time by sliding your mouse to the left edge of the screen At the bottom of the screen you see ldquo Software Management rdquo This is where to go for Save Load Options and Quit
When you click Cameras you see that only the Rotation function is active
Note You can drag the Rotation icon onto the camera screen to establish rotation for that camera only
It is best to click the word Rotation to affect all cameras
To rotate a camera hold the left mouse button down and drag
Now Lea asks you to click Maps on the menu
This produces a map of your present location and surroundings
The small blue wedge shows Lea rsquo s current location
You can see that she is in Room UD
Watch as Lea leaves the room and heads out to the corridor
Note The map can be dragged in any direction by clicking on the map surface and using the ldquo hand rdquo icon
This is especially helpful in locating room numbers so you can see where you are and decide where to go
You can also zoom in and out by placing the cursor over the map and rolling the mouse wheel
Also note the small arrows at the top right corner of the map ndash these will be important later
Turn on the camera nearest Lea on the back wall by clicking the red square
Note On my machine the mouse gets very twitchy if there is more than one camera running
I found it best to turn off unneeded cameras and use only one at a time
UD Lea heads toward the adjoining room and you need to activate another camera to follow her
She finds that the lights do not work and heads back to the corridor to flip the master switch
When she returns to the room click the nearest light red circle
Lea suggests that you lead her by turning on lights in the locations you want her to go
She finds nothing of interest in UD UD Click lights to move Lea toward UD
Note that the door to that room is red meaning it is closed
Click the door to open it and Lea enters
Note In this room you see cameras and lights along with triangles that represent possible special places of interest or objects
Click the red triangle to turn it blue and invite Lea to go there
My experience was that you should click on every camera and rotate it fully left and right up and down in order for Lea to find things
Not every camera or location will produce anything but the only way to know is to try
The important triangle here is the one on the left side of the room
Lea finds a night vision cartridge and loads it in the computer
Now you have a new camera function call Brightness
Turn on the camera nearest to Lea and click Brightness to confirm that it is working
You can use this function for any camera as needed
Note When a camera is on you can toggle night vision from the small panel of icons at the lower right of the camera screen
Lea enters two objectives in the Objectives panel in the menu
Click on that to read them
She also explains how the Help panel on the menu can be used
Go ahead and try that
UD Now Lea needs to go to Room UD
Lead her to the door at the left end of the corridor and find it is blocked
Turn on the camera on the other side of the door and turn on night vision
This frightens a man who is holding the door shut and you can rotate the camera to follow his escape
When you enter UD do not go near the stairs at the left
Just work toward the door of UD
UD Open the door to UD and lead Lea in
This is a flooded ldquo bleachery rdquo and there is nothing to see here
However Lea has a flashback to a conversation with a man
Note It gives a little a way but it helps to know that the man is Receptor one of the ldquo volunteers rdquo on whom deadly experiments are being done
Later you learn that Lea had strong feelings for him
UD Lead Lea through the opening on the left into UD the boiler room
Explore the room using the cameras and clicking on the lights until Lea finds a key on the floor
Note sometimes clicking on a light brings Lea to the location and you have to click the light off and on again for her to examine whatever is in that location
You will find that the camera windows map and menu boxes become layered on top of one another possibly covering up what you want to see
Clicking on a portion of the window or box brings that one up to the top so you can see it more clearly
Also you can move an entire window to a different part of the screen by clicking on the colored title bar at the top of the window and dragging it
UD Lead Lea back out through UD and out the door into area UD Do not go near the stairs on the left Just keep using lights to take her northward
After the second light Lea has another flashback this time to an exam table surrounded by Lea and two men
It appears that the patient is
Lea peers into UD and sees a dead person whom she believes is Dr Zeitfel
He appears to have a magnetic card that Lea needs to enter another room
This results in a new Objective
UD Lead Lea up to UD and enter
Try turning on the lights but they are not working
Lea suggests night vision brightness and using the various objects around the room
Donotgo near the red door at the bottom of the room
I got stuck there and never could move away
Just work your way across the center of the room by clicking the triangles in order
Your goal is the opening into UD
UD Lead Lea into UD and turn on the camera without night vision
Lea sees a mutant plant and recalls the work done by Francois Pierre
UD Return to UD and go to the door at the bottom of the room
It leads to UD but it is code protected
Lea decides to give you access to the Intranet which contains her records and those of the other ldquo Collaborators rdquo She gives her user name and password to you l nichols eurythmia Enter these at the top of the menu
Click Validate then click on Collaborators
Then click Lea rsquo s picture to access her records
Go to the very bottom of the form to find the door rsquo s access code
Note While you have Lea rsquo s records open you might want to look at her files and mail as well
They give you a good idea of the personalities of some of her colleagues and of Lea rsquo s relationship with Receptor
You cannot access her ldquo sensitive files rdquo without a code
UD Click the locked door and enter the access code
Lea enters and says we need to ldquo get in there rdquo by which she means UD
Go into the room on the left and explore until Lea finds a cassette and a small camera
She inserts the cassette and thereby activates the Zoom function
Click ldquo Zoom rdquo to activate it on all cameras
Note You can zoom in and out by placing the cursor on the camera screen and rolling the mouse wheel or by holding down therightmouse button over the camera screen and dragging the mouse up or down
Lea moves to the robot and inserts the camera
However the robot needs a code to work
Lea believes Professor Zeitfel had the code in his record
She tells you his user name but she doesn rsquo t know the password
Zeitfel was forgetful and wrote it down somewhere
Now you need to look for it
Use the camera at the upper left corner of the room pan downward and zoom in
You may need to enable night vision brightness on that camera and use the large window size
Note You can adjust window size by clicking on the small squares at the very top of each camera window
You will see the word ldquo memoriam rdquo and the numbers ldquo rdquo Now you have what you need to access the file username m zeitfel password memoriam sensitive files Note To open up a sensitive file scroll down through the files of that particular Collaborator accessed through ldquo Files rdquo in the main menu on the left of the screen until you see the red sensitive file bar
Click on the sensitive file bar and enter the code
You see that the robot code is AG
You also see the door code that you already have
Look at everything for Zeitfel
Note especially the entry regarding Receptor
Under ldquo Secured official code rdquo you find the user names and passwords for John Palmer and Mike Loyd
username j palmer username m loyd password ud password Look at Palmer rsquo s files and mail
Note especially that ldquo area servers rdquo must be switched in order to move from one sector to another
Look at Loyd rsquo s files and mail especially regarding and the mail exchange with Lea
Neither Palmer nor Loyd have any access codes
Now you need to get that magnetic card
Click the robot and enter the code AG
Robot control mechanisms are displayed
You need to maneuver through the air lock to UD
The robot automatically goes into the air lock
Click on the up down right and left arrows to move the robot through the opening into the next room across the way
The cameras in this room can be helpful or at least interesting enough to use
Move up close to the right side of the body and see the card lying on the table
Zoom in if necessary
Line up the robot rsquo s arm with the card and then use the arm controls to lower it
I found setting both controls to worked well
If the arm doesn rsquo t lower properly back the robot up a bit so the arm doesn rsquo t hit the table at the wrong angle
Once the arm is lowered press the center button on the navigation wheel to magnetize it
When you bring the arm back up you should see the magnetic card on it
If not keep maneuvering
Now move the robot out of UD across the air lock and back to the opposite room where Lea is waiting
Move up close to Lea and she takes the magnetic card
Lea automatically leaves and heads for the area switch
She uses it to move to a new area the Comparative Experimental Ethology Lab
This is the zone UD UD on the upper deck
Comparative Ethology Lab Upper Deck UD Turn a camera or cameras on near Lea so you can examine this new location
Turn left into the first room
Lea has a flashback about that scumbag Mike Loyd
Move into the adjoining room and explore until Lea is close to a plant that she says moves like an animal
UD To get to UD you have to go through the room to the left of it on the map because there is debris blocking the doorways
There is also debris farther down the corridor
Explore this room and then enter and explore UD
Continue on through the next room and on into UD
UD This is the room where the HO is stored but it is destroyed
Lea says that she will need to make HO and she adds Objectives
Light the safe at the lower left corner of the room
Lea goes there and finds an HO ingredient
She goes back to the computer and updates the first HO objective
Then she returns to the safe or lead her back there and finds the password for Francois Pierre
You can rsquo t see it so she decides to write it on the blackboard
Watch where she goes and activate the needed camera
Zoom in and see that the password is tyriades
You can assume his user name
username f pierre password tyriades In Pierre rsquo s file you see two access codes
Freezer B Vault Look at Pierre rsquo s files and mail for quite a lot of useful information
In particular file cryptology Polybius square and Blaise rsquo s grid mail Polybius square with code polybe key to tank CT Lea found this key in the boiler NOOB is the password for all personnel of rank level Blaise de Vigenere decryption method Note Dimitrinko says that his Polybius Square encryption is for Pierre rsquo s sensitive files password
It decodes to ldquo polybe rdquo but I was not able to get that to work
A person on the Gameboomers Forum said that ldquo polybius rdquo worked for her
It did for me too
We will come back to this much later
Dimitrinko gives Pierre instructions for using Blaise rsquo s grid along with an exercise
The instructions are a little convoluted so here is how I worked it out

Write the encrypted letters with the key word letters directly above

If you run out of key word letters just start from the beginning
B L A I S E B L A I N Z N L S C K F L G
Go down the first column to find the first letter of the keyword B

Go across the row of that letter to find the corresponding encrypted letter N

From there go up to the first row and record the letter found there M

Repeat for all the other letters
B L A I S E B L A I N Z N L S C K F L G M O N D A Y J U L Y Dimitrinko says that this is his ldquo indirect password rdquo Move Lea to the object at the upper right side of the room
It is a kind of freezer containing HO
To open the freezer enter the code found in Pierre rsquo s file B
Lea takes a drink but she needs more HO to inhale
UD Leave UD and move to UD on the other side of the corridor
Upon entering Lea has a flashback of a sexual encounter
Continue into the room and find three things you may have to click on the lights twice or use the cameras twice to get Lea to find everything
Clothing of Abdalah Melik and a key that Lea takes

Uniform of Andy Leonard and another key that Lea takes

Lea rsquo s log book
Lea gives you some additional information about and tells you her sensitive files password arcane
Retrieve Lea rsquo s files and use ldquo arcane rdquo to access her sensitive files

Under secured codes you find the information for John Palmer already known from Zeitfel

Under you see a log of Lea rsquo s dealings somewhat romantic with

A description of the sinister Loyd rsquo s extortion racket
UD Move into UD and help Lea find a mirror
UD Continue into UD and discover the body of Abdalah Melik
Corridor Go back out through the three rooms and out into the main corridor
The first triangle you see on your left is the activation server to take you up to the poop deck
Go there and click the server
Hint Once Lea goes up you need to click the up arrow on your map to display the map of the area
Lab Rooms and Dining Room stDeck P Go directly to Room P
Along the way Lea rsquo s notes bullet holes
After you enter the room use the lower camera and lights to hear Lea rsquo s description of the research that was being performed
At the other end of the room help Lea find a letter written by Andre Mourin
Lea saves it in her files and you can access the letter there
Note that the letter also contains codes for Abdalah Melik
username a melik password neuroleptic sensitive UYUCVUW encrypted Take a look at Melik rsquo s files and note the one about manufacturing synthetic HO a process that Lea might need later

Leave the room and go to the right
The object there will allow you to go out to the open deck
Outer Deck Area First Deck Move Lea to the end of the deck left on the map and keep going until you see the first object
The area camera shows a staircase leading up Switch to the upper map level using the up arrow on your map and turn on the light at the top of the stairs to bring Lea up
Second Deck Whether or not you are using night vision Lea will find it dark and dangerous
She suggests a spotlight ldquo up there rdquo by which she means the camera light combined icons that are opposite her and slightly lower on the map
Note the camera and light icons are so close together it is difficult to turn them both on
If you are looking for the camera for instance hover the cursor over an icon until the text identifying it pops up ndash if the text identifies it as a light move the cursor ever so slightly until the text changes to indicate that the cursor is over the camera
Then click
Turn on both the camera and the light and using night vision brightness scan around to find the path you need to lead Lea to the next stairway
The path looks like wide boards
Lea should follow the path as you light it
If not after you have the path well in mind shut off the night vision and slowly use the spotlight to guide Lea along the path of boards to the next stairway
She goes up to the Third Deck
Third Deck Explore the area and try the ship rsquo s horn the object at the right
Move her to the lower left of the area
If she doesn rsquo t automatically go back down to the Second Deck click the down arrow on the top right corner of the map and then click the closest light to Lea and she rsquo ll go back down to the Second Deck
Second Deck Move Lea to the bottom left corner where she finds barrels blocking the stairway down
She moves the barrels and then rests
Do not go down the stairway now
Instead move along the bottom to the right and find the object associated with the second deck this leads to section P P
You are looking for P
At the intersection open the bottom door
A key is needed but Lea has it
P You are in Dr Melik rsquo s cabin
Use the computer which is the first object in the room
Lea finds and installs the thermal function for the cameras
Light Lea rsquo s way farther into the room and she finds the hospital key P on the floor near the desk
Go behind the desk and click the other object
It is the telephone and it rings
Lea answers it but she can rsquo t hear anything
Use the telephone again
This time Lea hears you and you have unlocked the dispensary
Leave the room and head north along the long corridor
Turn left and enter the dispensary
P Look around with the cameras and lights
Lea finds some chemicals but she cannot remember what to do
For review look at Melik rsquo s Personal File ldquo Heat Response of HO Ingredients rdquo It says that tryethylen oxylate heated to degrees produces a bioluminescent glow and converts to sodium sulfate crystals
Lea mentions an air conditioner ndash at this point you rsquo ll see a triangle air conditioner appear near Lea on the map
Turn on the air conditioner
Set the dial up and turn on thermal vision on the camera that shows the bottles on the desk
Use the thermal camera function looks like a bulls eye on the tryethylen oxylate bottles
Ignore Lea rsquo s complaints about the heat
Setting the dial to degrees will usually heat the ingredient in the bottle to degrees
Hint although setting the dial to degrees usually works on one playthrough worked
And on another playthrough nothing would work ndash if this happens to you try leaving Room P altogether and then return and try again
If you do this correctly you see the glow Lea takes the tryethylen oxylate and leaves the dispensary
Note Save your game here If you leave the game in the middle of the next challenge you may need to return to a saved game
P The oven is in the back of the room
Turn on the uppermost camera ndash the one between the two octagonal structures on the map this gives you a back view of the inside of the oven
Click on the light nearest to this camera ndash this will lead Lea to the oven
She fiddles with the oven and produces the second ingredient
Watch this process ndash you rsquo ll need to do something similar in a minute
Go to Melik rsquo s Personal File and review ldquo Manufacturing Synthetic HO rdquo You need units of the red ingredient and units of the blue ingredient
The mixture must be heated to degrees
When Lea asks for your help click the object on the map that appears near the back of the oven
You rsquo ll need to enter a code ndash it rsquo s from Dr Melik rsquo s files ndash CX
A control panel is displayed
Press the arm at the bottom to boot the system
You see full columns of red and blue ingredients
Note if at any point you get the wrong combination of ingredients you can always reboot the process by clicking on the sign on the control panel
Inside the oven is a small robot that can be moved left right forward and back by clicking on the arrows on the menu using the mouse
The small robot can also be lifted vertically with the space bar or by clicking on the center circle of the menu
Position the robot directly under the tube coming down from the ceiling of the oven you may need to move the camera around a bit to see the ceiling of the oven and then the floor of the oven to see how to move the robot to align it with the ceiling tube
You know the robot is in the right position when you use the space bar to raise the robot up into the tube and colored gas comes down into the glass globe of the robot ndash and you rsquo ll also see the bars on the menu registering how much of the substance has gone into the robot You can do either blue first then red or vice versa
Extract units of red and move the robot to the other tube to extract units of blue
Lea has something to say when you have done this correctly
Now move the robot so that it is struck by the laser beam shining horizontally through the oven
Turn on the thermal function so that you can watch temperatures
Adjust the thermal dial bulls eye so that it is right where the robot and laser meet
Use the space bar or click on the center circle on the menu to lift the glass globe of ingredients up to the laser beam you may have to hit the space bar or click repeatedly to keep the robot at the right level
Hold the globe in the laser not too high not too low and watch the temperature go up to degrees
Release the globe immediately when the temperature is right
Lea will tell you when to stop
Note if you have managed to save your game while in the middle of this challenge you may not be able to access the oven when you return via that saved game If this happens you may be able to use the Automatic Backup very first save in the ldquo load rdquo menu instead The Automatic Backup will not show the triangle object on the oven though ndash you have to click the light near the oven again so that Lea will talk about the process and then the triangle on the oven appears
Lea grabs the HO and hurries off to the Inhalation Lab
You will need to switch the map levels until you find her
Outer Deck Go to the bottom left of the area and through to the place where Lea removed the barrels from the stairway
Switch the map level down and bring Lea down the stairs
Move her up across the stern and then across the top to the right until she reaches the entrance to P P
Activate the switch to enter the area
Lab Rooms and Dining Room stDeck Bring Lea straight down the corridor and into P
Lea sees three corpses that she is reluctant to touch
By turning on various lights and an object you can persuade her to search them
She thinks that one is the Professor Resa Leeglind rsquo s daughter Mathilda and wonders whether Mathilda is the password
username r leeglind assumed password mathilda The main item of interest is the access code for P P FR D
P Go to the airlock between P and P
Enter the access code just found FR D
Lea enters the inhalation lab
After she enters information in the computer you can lead Lea into the inhalation chamber
She has a flashback of someone who did not do well there
When she is finished she says she feels better
Leave the area out to the corridor and head north
P Turn right into P and turn on the cameras
Click the object and hear the phone ring
You are telling Lea to fix the wiring
Now the archives console is powered up but you need a code to access it P A from Mourin rsquo s file
Browse through the various files paying particular attention to the Z audio file in which you get the passwords for Lincoln you already have and Andy Leonard
username a leonard password P Leonard rsquo s file contains the access code for Security Room P P U P Use the preceding access code to enter P where Lea finds Leonard rsquo s body
Use the light and object at the bottom of the room to have Lea examine him
Note in one playthrough Lea could explore this room but could not be made to search Leonard rsquo s body until after she had already explored rooms P P and P
Lea learns Leonard rsquo s sensitive files password and goes to the computer to record it in her file
Open Lea rsquo s files to learn Leonard rsquo s sensitive password rigour
Open Leonard rsquo s sensitive file and see information about possible spying and a list of crew member characteristics
You have all the codes except the ones for Paul de Provence username p provence password ra Opening Provence rsquo s file reveals nothing much of interest
Keep exploring until you find a panel of keys
I can tell you the correct key but that would spoil all the fun
Just select any available key at random
Note in one playthrough Lea could explore this room but could not be made to find the panel of keys until after she had already explored rooms P P and P
P Leave the Security Room and pause outside the entrance to P
Before entering switch on the first camera in P ndash the one nearest the door Then make Lea enter through the door
Lea is confronted by a beast
Use the object to her left to emit steam and chase the beast away
Continue through P and P exploring as you go
P Enter examine the carcass and hear Lea tell more about tyriades
Continue down toward the bottom of the room where Lea finds Provence rsquo s body
She also finds a notebook with Provence rsquo s favorite recipe and probably the code to his sensitive files bouillabaisse
She also finds a secret notebook with codes
Open Provence rsquo s files and use the code above to access his sensitive files
These are clearly the reports of a spy
The third report refers to and describes a charm necklace
Have you been wondering about that necklace Lea is wearing
Head back through the rooms toward P If you haven rsquo t examined Leonard rsquo s body yet or picked up a random key go back into P and do these things
Go to the corridor to the right of P
Then go upward to the door leading outside
The map label is ldquo P P CT rdquo Activate the switch and step out to the open deck
Outer Deck Area For reference the bow of the ship is to the right and the stern is to the left
Work your way around to the right until you reach the bridge the narrow walkway that leads far off to the right
Lea encounters dogs and she is unwilling to go out there
Come down to the bottom part of the deck and work your way to the left
At the stern Lea finds and picks up an animal carcass that might be used to distract the dogs
Go back to the bow on the right where Lea feeds the carcass to the dogs thereby clearing the way
Now head out over the long bridge until Lea reaches the end
At the small rectangular area come down switch the map to a lower level and use lights to take her down
Lea is now in the hatch area
Use the lower right camera with night vision brightness if you need it and lights to move Lea to the hatch
Note the lettering on the hatch CT T
Unless you were very lucky the key she took from the Security room does not work
If youwerelucky then skip the next paragraph Upon learning that the key is wrong Lea sees the lettering and automatically starts heading back to the Security room to get the right key
After switching the map level up lead her all the way back over the bridge up around the open deck and in though the door you exited before
Return to the Security room P and go to the key panel again
Select key under the CTT column and Lea confirms that it is the right key
Now retrace your steps all the way back across the bridge and down to the hatch area
Lea uses the good key and before going down flicks the area server switch
Workshop Tanks CT T Lea arrives in a large cargo hold
Look around a little and then enter the door to CT C
CT C Lead Lea to the thing with a disk shaped end
Lea goes to the computer and updates the Objectives
She looks up and hears a man talking to her
He says that Lea has slept for years that he commands the ship now and he is scared of all the creatures
He instructs Lea to retrieve an egg that is about to hatch
It is on the funnel or smoke stack
She adds this task to the Objectives
The funnel is on the third deck by that ship rsquo s horn you saw earlier
Yes you have to go there
Funnels Here is the route
Leave the cargo hold and go up the stairs in CT T

Switch the map level up and return to the bridge

Cross the bridge back to the open deck

Come downward and go left to the stern

Go to the light at the bottom between the two triangles arrow points to UD UD ndash don rsquo t click the triangles

Switch the map level up and go to the second deck P where the barrels are

Use the triangle object diagonally across from the barrels
Lea goes there

Switch the map level up and go up to the third deck P

Go to the end of the funnel and click possibly twice on both lights
Lea climbs a ladder attached to the funnel
Use the camera to look up at the top of the funnel and see the birds
This prompts Lea to say things
She suggests using the siren ship rsquo s horn to scare the birds
Click the triangle at the right to blow the horn
Lea gets the egg
Turn off the two funnel lights and Lea automatically goes all the way back to CT T
She suggests using the time to go through files but I think it is better to wait until she gets to her destination
Note When Lea arrives back at CT T I recommend that you not continue into CT C and be sure to save your game here
Once you go into the other room you will be engaged in a looping conversation that cannot be broken by a Save or even a Quit without an error Workshop Tanks With Lea in CT T we can look at some files
Access the main menu on screen left
Go to Collaborators
In Namrik rsquo s mail you found Kim Lan Lee rsquo s password
username kl lee password yokobue Open her file and learn Access code for the gate to the ocean CT Bathyscaphe information Linda Manchek username l manchek password archi sensitive ocean Stephen Algun username s algun password s algun sensitive s algun Now open Linda Manchek rsquo s files using the codes on the preceding page
A list of codes with the seventh one not shown
Bathyscaphe codes operations manual and protocols Aquatic path Open Stephen Algun rsquo s files using the codes at the top of this page
Access code for door to CT CT A Now it is time to deliver the egg
CT C Go into CT C and to that disk shaped thing again
The man arrives and a lengthy conversation takes place
Lea now recognizes him as Mike Loyd
Loyd wants to know who the traitor was
As he recites names swing the camera left and right for ldquo No rdquo up and down for ldquo Yes rdquo From your reading of Provence rsquo s files you know he was the one
Keep swinging the camera until Lea responds
Loyd comments on Lea rsquo s charm necklace and he gives her the key for maneuvering the bathyscaphe until the exit lock
He also gives her glowing creatures to light the way
Loyd tells Lea about the tanks Tank Status flooded spare parts Loyd could not open it
bathyscaphe tank completely dark change room needs to be searched there were rumors about them Loyd does not have the keys Finally he gives out his file codes username m loyd password sensitive oxoldines After Lea updates the Objectives open Loyd rsquo s file
It contains Igor Dimitrinko rsquo s sensitive file code pigpen
You still don rsquo t know the password
The files also contain three blueprints for bombs
Also the story of Provence telling of a ldquo charm rdquo that could regulate the need for HO
Your next destination is CT B
Do not leave the way you came in
Instead go to that thing with the disk shaped end and then pan the map around to find the way to CT B
Use lights to lead Lea around to the far left side of the map and then use the server switch at the bottom left corner
Submersible Deck Tanks CT B When Lea arrives in CT B go forward to the locked door to the storeroom
Use Namrik rsquo s code to open the door SW
Go in and look around
In particular choose the light in the center for Lea to see fuses
She decides there is nothing of interest here and automatically leaves
Bring Lea down to the bottom of the room switch the map level up and light her way along the stairs to the room below Then switch the map level back down
CT B Move Lea to the door at the bottom right corner of the room
Open it and move her into the next room
It is CT C but it is not labeled clearly on the map
Note If you have trouble clicking on the door icon go to the bottom portion of the map menu and click to disable ldquo Lights rdquo This will make it much easier to click on the door Then be sure to re enable ldquo Lights rdquo in the bottom portion of the map menu
CT C Bathyscaphe Area The room is dark so use night vision brightness
Lea realizes the power is out and she needs a fuse
She goes to the computer and enters a new Objective
Open Namrik rsquo s file and look at the Tank Electrical System folder
You see that the fuse she needs for CT C is red Retrace your steps back to CT B
Don rsquo t forget to switch map level up and down to negotiate the stairs
CT B Go up to the door that needs an access code
Use Namrik rsquo s code SW
Warning Don rsquo t turn on any lights in here because Lea will think you mean to take the fuse there
She will automatically return to CT C only to find it is the wrong fuse
Note In one playthrough picking up two fuses one right and one wrong and carrying them both around before using the right one did not cause any problems with gameplay
Use the cameras and zoom to locate the red fuse
The one that works is the camera at the lower right of the storeroom
With some zoom you see the red fuse up on a metal walkway
There isn rsquo t nearly as much red on the fuse as Namrik rsquo s file indicates but the fuse still works
Switch the map level up and click the blue triangle lower right near the fuse
Lea climbs the stairs and takes the fuse
Switch back down and watch Lea automatically leave the storeroom and return to CT C
CT C Lea enters the room replaces the fuse says it works and checks off the Objective
Work your way up along the left side of the large circular airlock in the center of the room
For the best view switch to the camera above the circular airlock ndash turning the night vision brightness function on the camera to ldquo on rdquo may help
Approach the airlock and Lea asks for the code CT
Move Lea to the door at the upper right corner of the room in front of the door
Note If you have trouble clicking on the door icon go to the bottom portion of the map menu and click to disable ldquo Lights rdquo This will make it much easier to click on the door Then be sure to re enable ldquo Lights rdquo in the bottom portion of the map menu
CT T Enter the room which is Dimitrinko rsquo s office and workspace
Lea goes to a computer and tells you to look in the files
This is premature however so click the triangle at the upper left of the room to break her free
Lea may insist that you log in under Francois Pierre rsquo s name To do this go to Collaborators click on Pierre rsquo s picture and click ldquo Validate rdquo Lea instructs you to read his correspondence ndash so you click on the ldquo Mail rdquo bar Once you have done this Lea will now respond when you click the lights to get her to move
On the desk Lea finds a camera add on for Sharpness and loads it
Nearby on the desk Lea finds a key but she doesn rsquo t know what it opens
Farther down she finds Dimitrinko rsquo s ldquo agenda rdquo a kind of calendar with dates and words
You may have to click the lights on the desk several times before she finds this
Recall that you earlier decrypted Dimitrinko rsquo s code to obtain MONDAYJULY which he described as his indirect password
Lea loads the digital agenda into the computer ndash you can look for it under ldquo Agenda rdquo in the files under any of the Collaborators
Look under July on the list and find Monday mediocritas
Now you have full access to Dimitrinko rsquo s files
Use the main menu to add Dimitrinko as a validated Collaborator
username i dimitrinko password mediocritas sensitive pigpen from Loyd Access Dimitrinko rsquo s files
For the entrance lock to the subterranean base three keys are needed U Z X M L F Another file shows the protocols for using those keys
He also shows encryption key words BLAISE his CESAR Melik rsquo s sensitive files HILL file owned by Lincoln and Leonard ldquo Reminiscent Anamnesis part rdquo ALBERTI file owned by Lincoln ldquo Reminiscent Anamnesis part rdquo He also has an encryption decryption program
He also shows Lyse Montflour rsquo s password X AU
He thinks the sensitive files password is the name of a family member
See also a hidden video of Kim
When it zooms in on her tablet pause it and read the two words written there
This will probably take some gamma adjustments
The words are ldquo yokobue rdquo Kim rsquo s password that you already have and what is probably her sensitive password gagaku
username kl lee password yokobue sensitive gagaku Come farther down into the room with a movie projector
Lea finds a digital version and loads it in the computer
Access Lea rsquo s shared files and view ldquo The Magnetic Rift rdquo Search around for Linda Manchek rsquo s locker
On the side of her locker is a list of coded letters
These are clues to the code for bathyscaphe
If you have trouble seeing the letters open Manchek rsquo s file and find them there
You saw the earlier
Now Lea wants you to figure out what the current code is
Line UA ZY PE TO Pattern A Line UZ AY PT EO swap letters swap letters Line U ZA Y P TE O Pattern B Line U ZY A T PE O swap letters swap letters Line U ZY A T PE O Pattern C Line E Z UA Y P TO Bring thletter to front swap all pairs Line EZ UA Y P TO Pattern A Line EU ZA Y T PO Line E UZ AY TP O Pattern B Line E UA ZT YP O Line E U A ZT YP O Pattern C Line PU E Z AY TO Thus the code for Bathyscaphe is PUEZAYTO Move Lea over to the changing room at the center of the left wall and she changes into the bathyscaphe suit provided the camera is not on her
Continue along the right side until you find Dimitrinko rsquo s locker
Lea opens it with the key she just found
She finds a data cartridge an inscribed photo of Lyse Montflour and what looks like a cryptology manual
She loads the data cartridge but a look at Lea rsquo s file shows that it contains Dimitrinko rsquo s sensitive password pigpen that you already have
Bring Lea to the door at the bottom
The key that she found in the boiler room ashes opens it
Tyriadontology Rooms Tanks CT T Lea finds a veritable natural history museum
Look all around and click on everything but avoid the two squares with lights near the bottom of the map for now
Move her to the office at the upper left corner of the room upper right on the map
Lea finds a data cartridge that suggests another intelligent species on Earth
Read Algun rsquo s report under Lea rsquo s file ldquo My Knowledge rdquo Have Lea leave the office and go down toward the two squares with lights
The left one will take her into CT C
CT C Above the ground level are two levels of walkways
Work your way up to the top level which requires quite a lot of map level switching
Lea sees some corpses up there
Bring her back down and return her to CT T
Move on through CT T and into the bathyscaphe chamber CT C Submersible Deck Tanks CT C Lea is about to take a ride on the bathyscaphe
Before you do anything else you would do well to visit Manchek rsquo s files and read up on how to navigate the bathysphere and how to engage the three keys
I will provide the information a little later
First Lea has to pick up the bathyscaphe and deposit it in the circular opening in the center of the room
The gate airlock was opened earlier
Lifting Arm for the Bathyscaphe Move Lea to the right side of the chamber and switch the map level up
Lead Lea up the stairs to a platform
This is the control mechanism for picking up and moving the bathyscaphe
A lifting arm menu appears The small white squares on the left of the lifting arm menu are actually buttons To lift the bathyscaphe you must click and drag these buttons that operate the mechanical arm It will be helpful at this stage to turn on three cameras and perhaps to turn on the night vision brightness function on some of the cameras to point at the opening and help you see your progress
Move the controls slowly
Here is some guidance on picking up the bathyscaphe Leave C at Move A to max Move B to max Move D slowly to the right until Lea says ldquo Be careful rdquo Now drop the bathyscaphe into the opening
Watch the cameras
Slowly alternate moving B left and moving C right a little at a time C ends up at max B ends up at or almost at
Move A to
Slowly move D to max
If Lea says you don rsquo t have it right make slight adjustments Once the bathyscaphe is positioned properly Lea automatically climbs in and discusses your respective roles
Aquatic Zone A new kind of map is displayed
Some cameras are mounted on the bathyscaphe and the others are along the canyon
You must climb up the canyon to the area known as the Tyriades Spine and find the entrance to the advance base
Your job is to manage the operation of the bathyscaphe the lights and the arm
Lea says that the first task is to familiarize ourselves with the bathyscaphe and she asks for the code PUEZAYTO
Be sure to turn on the bathyscaphe light s
The navigation control panel can be toggled by using the triangle in the bathyscaphe in the inset Manchek rsquo s file gives you the order of initialization MG W CONNECT V MG SX LB Manchek rsquo s file also gives the navigation information you need rotate left go forward rotate right move laterally left move laterally right go backward Page Up ascend Page Down descend Enter deploy arm Note The keystrokes listed above might work on your keyboard but they didn rsquo t on mine
In a later playthrough the keystrokes worked but only if I rsquo d clicked on the menu control panel first
In any case using the control panel is easier
Move your mouse around the control panel to see what movements are available and play with them a little to get a feel for them
The scale on the right is for ascending and descending
Before taking the Bathyscaphe trip through the Aquatic Zone save your game
Bathyscaphe Trip Through the Canyons Aquatic Zone ZA Lea tells you to descend so press the down arrow on the control paneluntil Lea says you are at the right depth
Note There are three on board cameras
The most important is the one that is directed forward and shows the bionic arm
Be sure to turn that camera on
As you work through the aquatic path you are likely to collide with walls and rocks frequently until you get lined up
Lea will complain but this is not a game ender
As you reach intermediate goals save the game
Keep panning around and look for blue areas
Those are generally the places you need to follow
You will need to adjust depths frequently
Be sure to use all available cameras to help with your navigation
There are two ways to reach your goal the scenic route and the easy route The scenic route will show you the challenging rugged canyon interior
It rsquo s beautiful and it can also be intensely frustrating
The easy route shows you mostly blue water
Since you rsquo ve saved your game you can try the scenic route and then return to the easy route if the scenic route isn rsquo t working out
Scenic Route Through the Canyons Aquatic Zone Now move south toward the canyon camera below
When you get there turn until the arm is facing southwest and you see a blue area in the distance
Go in that direction toward the next camera
Pass a little north of that camera
Lea mentions the ldquo Ring of the Titans rdquo and you see a faint outline of an underwater archway
Go west toward the arch which comes into clearer focus
You need to go under the arch so you must descend quite a bit
Navigate to face the water below the arch
Turn on the camera directly west of you and pan it so that it faces the arch from the other side i e so that it faces the bathyscaphe
Now work your way under and through the arch with the west camera helping to guide you
Continue to and past the west camera
Lea congratulates you and mentions a stone ldquo spur rdquo in the distance
It actually looks a little like a column
Head that way and right of the ldquo column rdquo See a dark blue opening if you have turned your night vision brightness on turn it off to see this
Go through that opening and continue southwest toward the black triangle on the map Now Lea states a new Objective Reach the ldquo Tyriades Spine rdquo Head west through the gap by the black triangle
You come to another low arch so descend and approach the opening under the arch
Turn on the camera that is northwest of you to help guide you under and through the arch
Note that you are still going west
Look up and left to see an opening
Face that direction south and go through the opening
On your right you see boiling water which is not good
Look left and down to see an opening so descend to it
Turn on the camera south of you for guidance
As you go through the opening you are still going south straight toward the camera
Ahead you see more boiling water
This time go on through it
When Lea complains ascend until you see bubbles in the distance
Keep going south
Ascend a little more and see an opening southeast of you
Go through the opening and continue east toward the gray triangle on the map
At the gray triangle look southwest for some blue area
Go forward and descend into the key locks area ndash the base is near the center
Easy Route through the Canyons Alternate to Scenic Route Above Go forward south until you see the ground coming up close beneath you in the front camera
Ascend as high as possible Ignore Lea rsquo s protests
Continue directly south out of the shadowed basin area on the map into the pure white area If you bump on the ground try to go even higher or move slightly to the left or right to continue on
Once the ground drops beneath you descend slightly
At this stage drag the map to see your goal ndash the base is approximately south and west of you
Start edging west as well as going south monitoring your progress on the map since there aren rsquo t any cameras placed in the canyon near you When you are near the base on the map go south of where the map says ZA and go in the slight depression you rsquo ve essentially used a ldquo back door rdquo
When you are over the center area of the base on the map activate the cameras near the base and descend until the cameras can ldquo see rdquo the bathysphere
You are now in the area outside the advanced base and the key locks are around you
Key Locks Aquatic Zone ZA Go to the intersection of the cables that look like roots
On the map the locks are the white knob shapes attached to the ends of the cables When looking through the cameras you rsquo ll note that the locks are circular and each has a small light going around at the edge of the circle
Look at about o rsquo clock on the map top left or northwest on the map and see the first key lock
Approach it squarely and move up close using the bathyscaphe camera that has the arm sticking out front
Note For all three locks turn on the target click the ldquo on rdquo button at the bottom of the control panel
When you are close enough to the lock you will see a circular hole at its center ndash this is where you aim
Insert the arm into the hole
Lea should say ldquo Perfect rdquo Usually a box will appear for entering the code within a few seconds Occasionally it doesn rsquo t and you have to try to insert the arm in the center hole again
Now you have to enter the code for lock U Z
The second lock is in the back of the lower right area on the map
It is the same drill except this time there are currents that rock the bathysphere around
After you are up close you need to keep making quick adjustments but you can time them pretty well
Code X M
Finally the third lock is at the back of the lower left area on the map about o rsquo clock from the intersection
The obstacle here is heat and Lea says it has to be a one shot affair
For one thing you should keep the code handy so you can type it quickly L F
Now that you have opened all three locks you are ready for the main entrance lock at the middle of the zone
Watch the map as you move the bathyscaphe directly onto the square
Having all three non bathyscaphe cameras on so you can watch the bathyscaphe rsquo s orientation will also help
Then descend until Lea says she is there
She has a flashback of a time on the beach with
Advanced Base Lea switches to this new location and enters a new Objective Get to the Tyriades doors
She is on freight elevator at Level and wants to go down
Save the game here ndash there rsquo s a sequence coming up that you might want to replay to watch what rsquo s happening again
Take Lea down to Level and watch her descent on the map
There are things to explore on this level but you can do that later
Click the light beside her you may have to do this twice to take her back to the elevator
Take her down to Level
Make a mental note of where the elevator is on the map
At this stage turn on two cameras ndash the camera on the bottom left it will show the interior of an office
And the camera in the open area on the right lower portion of the map it rsquo s by the black square and below the two cylindrical tanks it will show a glass window that looks a bit like an old fashioned ticket booth and ndash harder to see ndash a small white R D like robot
Make sure the windows don rsquo t overlap and move them to the right of the screen because just as you want to look at them Lea will enter objectives that will make the main menu pop up at screen left
On this second camera something will emerge during the next sequence from the right there will be a quick interaction immediately in front of the ldquo ticket booth rdquo window and then the something will go back out screen right ndash you can follow this by panning the camera to the right now but do so only if you know you rsquo ll be quick to pan it back when the interaction occurs as most of the interaction takes place where the camera is currently aimed
BA Lea looks around and soon sees a shadow move
She asks that you use lights and cameras to find out what is going on
Click the office light left of where you came up on the elevator on the map it rsquo s near the lower left camera that you turned on earlier
Lea goes there and sees another body ndash you can watch her through the first camera that you rsquo ve already turned on
Ring the phone the red triangle on the desk
Lea sees that the body is that of Lyse Montflour
Lea takes a key and a map
She also looks at a photo of a family member
As suspected earlier the name is Lyse rsquo s sensitive files code MADY
Wait a few minutes before opening up the main menu to try entering the sensitive code though
After Lea looks at the photo watch through the other camera that you turned on earlier to see the ensuing action Lea attempts to leave the room but she is confronted by some kind of creature
Lea notes that her charm warned her and wonders what the connection is to the Tyriades
She thinks getting the power restored is needed and suggests a different floor
Before you leave you can now look at some files
Montflour username l montflour Password X AU Sensitive mady In Montflour rsquo s sensitive files you find more file information
Edwards sensitive sensuality Lowel username j lowel Password osssecan Sensitive melkhar Now look at Edward rsquo s sensitive files
She gives the codes for Montflour and Melik that you already have
Lincoln sensitive order Luciani username a luciani Password nialuci Sensitive hope Next look at the files of Lowel and his mails to Guirnisch
Abyss tunnel security door code XX K files reports on Tyriades queen legend of the charm Guirnisch username p guirnisch Password psi Sensitive symbiosis Lincoln rsquo s files offer two access codes Stealth A security robots ST RK Tyriades doors TEO To access the coded Reminiscent Anamnesis files in Lincoln rsquo s sensitive files ndash for Notes on Reminiscent Anamnesis Part highlight all the coded text by dragging with the mouse Hit Ctrl C on your computer keyboard
Validate Dimitrinko on the Collaborator rsquo s menu and access his sensitive files Open the Cryptography Executable
Click on Vigenere rsquo s Grid
Click on the lower large box until you see a blinking cursor Hit Ctrl V to paste the coded text in the lower box Then click on the upper box Key space until you see a blinking cursor and type in the word hill Then click on Decrypt and read the text

Luciani rsquo s files contain the protocol for open the Tyriades door
There is a drawing here that will be important later
Guirnisch rsquo s files contain friendly communication protocols a language lexicon and pheromones responses all likely to be needed later
Now return to where the elevator is and take Lea up to Level
Again make a note of where the elevator is on this level
BA Go to the locked door on your right
Lea updates the Objectives and then uses the key she just found to open the door
She heads in and down to an elevator for which she also has access
The elevator takes Lea up to the Control Room
BA ndash Control Room Lead Lea to the control panel the light at the center top of the map
Be patient as Lea fiddles around and wait until she says she needs to fix the generators
She updates the Objectives
Go back to the elevator on the right and return to Level
BA ndash Generator Room Open the door and go to the corridor leading up and to the right
Go all the way to the end and switch the map level up to see a stairway
Lead her up the stairs
Move her around the generator area to the upper right light on the generator
She sees the problem and needs a tool and suggests you find the workshop
Workshop Come down into the large rectangular area below the generator and work your way to the light at the upper left
Lea finds the biggest red wrench you have ever seen
Take her back out of the workshop and up to the upper right corner of the generator
She makes the repair and then automatically repairs the other one
Now she wants to see if everything is working in the Control Room
Take Lea back to the stairs at the lower right switch down and bring her down the stairs to the corridor
Come down the long corridor to the door she unlocked earlier through the door and down to the elevator
After she enters the elevator switch up to the Control Room area
BA ndash Control Room Take her to the center light again
Lea finds that everything is working properly
She enters a new Objective that of opening the Tyriades door
She suggests checking the files for how to do that
Meanwhile she swipes her card and a panel is displayed
Click the top item and enter Lincoln rsquo s access code TEO
Tyriades Door Puzzle Now you are presented with a control panel for an imaging puzzle
First shift the map to the lowest level
At the top of the arc of the map you see two vertical parallel lines Now drag the map upward and look for the camera that is directly south of the parallel lines
It is left of two cylindrical tanks
Activate the camera and see a glowing image on the Tyriades door
I recommend that you size the camera window to maximum and move the other boxes out of the way
The door image glows off and on but the five elements stay gold
The elements are associated with the five numbered boxes
For each element look around to see where it goes on the door
Then click the numbered box corresponding to that element and drag the box the box not the image to the approximate correct location
Use the size and rotate bars to match the element to the image on the door
When you have the right size and orientation and drag the element over the door image the element turns white
Lea congratulates you when all five are in place
Hint once you have a good idea of where each piece goes and have placed it as well as you can over its matching underlying design and have the rotation as close as possible try moving the size slider slowly back and forth to try various sizes
If this doesn rsquo t work you might need to readjust the placement of the piece or the rotation of the piece
Neutralizing the Security Robots Now Lea needs to go down to the Tyriades Doors but she needs to disable the security robots first
Go right to the elevator and take the elevator down
Switch down leave through the once locked door and go to the light at the top left of the two parallel lines
Take the elevator down to Level
BA Lea wants to go to the fallen robot and set it on remote control so you can use it to neutralize the other robots
Lead her to the room on the left
Turn on the camera out in the open area by the black square and below the two cylindrical tanks
You can see a fallen robot
Note This is your last chance to save for a while so SAVE NOW especially because your robot might be defeated falls over and you have to start again
Now use the light below the camera you used to view the Tyriades doors
You see Lea come out and repair the robot
You need to enter Lincoln rsquo s code ST RX
Now you are ready to attack the other robots
Use the same camera with night vision brightness and zoom as necessary to locate the three robots
Be patient and wait for them to come into view
Move to get into their paths and as soon as you are close get off a shot
If the robot ceases to move when you back away you have neutralized it
Try to shoot before the other robot does
If you are hit too often you are defeated T ndash After Going Through the Tyriades Doors Once you beat the three robots Lea heads for the Tyriades door and enters the training room
She equips herself with a portable camera and an endoscopic camera
She suggests that you do Tyriades research in the files of Guirnisch Edwards and Lowel
The Objectives have been updated
Look around the room
You should find a camera add on which is an audio decryption device for analyzing pheromones
You also find a data cartridge that serves as a remote control for the Language Pack
You can use this to emit pheromones as a way of communicating in the Tyriades world
The Language Pack is added to the menu on the left
Familiarize yourself with the Language Pack
Running your mouse over the five pheromones at the top displays information about each one
Note that the associated emotions are listed in the pheromone table in corresponding lines
For example the emotions for ldquo B rdquo are shown as the second lines in each of the top four sections of the table
The three squares at the bottom are for entering pheromones
The four circles at the bottom allow you to select the force of emission
Try for example emitting ldquo E rdquo as a stationary emission and hear Lea rsquo s response
To do this click on ldquo E rdquo ndash the ldquo E rdquo will appear in the box below
Then click on the circle with an ldquo o rdquo You rsquo ll hear the pheromones as they are launched and you rsquo ll usually see a colorful cloud of gas that contains the pheromones
You can also emit each of the other pheromones just to see Lea rsquo s response
T ndash Tyriades Zone Cathedral Try out Lea rsquo s portable camera to get the hang of it
If you don rsquo t see any camera icons showing up on the map at this point go to the lower part of the map and click on the camera icon in the legend to make the cameras show up on the map
The portable camera is the camera on the map that is now connected to the wedge icon identifying Lea
Head north out of the training room and cross a metal bridge
Keep going and cross a plank bridge
In the large area use the lights on the left to work your way up to the narrow passage labeled T T
When you cross the small up and down bridge your path is blocked by plants
Wait quite a while for Lea to say she has an idea
She then explains the functions of the Language Pack
Set the portable camera for pheromone mode and turn on the Language Pack
You must pan the camera directly at the plant so that a gray box appears if you can rsquo t get the portable camera to pan look to see if the top mode rotation above pheromone mode on the portable camera window is enabled
Pan the camera until the gray box is over the plant you want to communicate with select ldquo Euphoria rdquo gamma gamma and emit at force
The plant stands up and you are free to pass
In one playthrough this worked without an obvious sign that it had worked If you rsquo ve sent gamma gamma a few times it rsquo s possible that you didn rsquo t notice the plant standing up
Try clicking on the next light and see if Lea will go there
As you continue northward you encounter more plants
You can experiment by using the language pack if you like ndash it will work on some of the plants that aren rsquo t blocking your path
Sometimes the plant will ldquo talk rdquo back to you ndash you rsquo ll see symbols appearing in the gray box that you didn rsquo t send
One plant informed me pheromonically that it was terrified
ldquo Euphoria rdquo still works but you might have to adjust your force
Continue forward up into the narrow passage and go all the way north to the server switch at the top
Use the server switch to enter T
Tyriades Zone Crossroads You meet Miilyan a communications Tyriade
Turn on the pheromone function on you camera if it isn rsquo t already on in order to understand her
Lea and Miilyan hold a long conversation
You are missing the omega pheromone and you need to find it
Lea updates the Objectives
T You are in figure area
Come south to the area that consists roughly of three circles There are three different approaches to this section
The Original Approach to Highland Forest Omega Bubbles Involves T T and T For two other alternate approaches see below
This is the way the game designers assumed this area would be played
Stop now and carefully read the communication and language information in Paul Guirnisch rsquo s files
You will be working your way through the Highland Forest looking for the Omega Bubbles dodging Combat Tyriades and trying to communicate with the ones you don rsquo t manage to dodge
If you don rsquo t communicate correctly you will have what seems to be a flashback and then will be returned back to the Highland Forest to keep trying to get to the Omega Bubbles
It can be difficult to communicate accurately at all times because you don rsquo t yet have the omega pheromone which is a vital element for communication
Note that there are two server switches for T T at the bottoms of the circles
Use either switch to enter the highland forest at location T
Lea has a flashback involving in trouble and she is certain she has been here before
Lea says that she can see a Combat Tyriades patrolling the area Keep searching the forest until you find the omega bubbles If you encounter plants enabling the pheromone function on the portable camera and using gamma gamma will still work on them
You may not be aware that a plant is blocking you ndash if you can rsquo t advance to the next light use gamma gamma and then see if clicking on the light allows you to advance
After you arrive at the bubbles Lea tries to take one but she is unsuccessful
Use ldquo Ecstasy rdquo alpha alpha at force to freeze the bubbles
Immediately use ldquo Desire rdquo beta beta at force or ldquo Enchantment rdquo delta delta and Lea grabs the omega pheromone
Now you need to return to T
You can use the nearest switch
Use gamma gamma as needed on plants you encounter on your way back to the server switch
Use the switch to leave the highland forest
Back at T your goal now is the labeled T T area switch above the upper left circular area
Take Lea under the leftmost circle
About lights away from the switch to T T stop to save your game
Note Save your game before going farther
It will be a loooong time before you can save again

The Quick Pick Approach to the Highland Forest Omega Bubbles Involves T T and T Alternate to Original Approach Above Note that there are two server switches for T T at the bottoms of the circles
You want to use the closest switch but only briefly Activate the switch to enter the highland forest at location T
Lea has a flashback involving in trouble and she is certain she has been here before
Lea says that she can see a Combat Tyriades patrolling the area As soon as you can activate the switch toreturnto T
The game will now let you work your way through the southern portion of T to the server switch that takes you directly to T where the Omega pheromone plant is located
Work all the way around the circles until you are under the leftmost circle and then lead Lea south along the path leading down to another T T switch brings you in at location T
Turn on the camera at the bottom of the area and see the omega bubbles
Now Lea needs to work her way down in that direction
If you encounter plants enabling the pheromone function on the portable camera and using gamma gamma will still work on them
You may not be aware that a plant is blocking you ndash if you can rsquo t advance to the next light use gamma gamma and then see if clicking on the light allows you to advance
After you arrive at the bubbles Lea tries to take one but she is unsuccessful
Use ldquo Ecstasy rdquo alpha alpha at force to freeze the bubbles
Immediately use ldquo Desire rdquo beta beta at force or ldquo Enchantment rdquo delta delta and Lea grabs the omega pheromone
Now you need to leave the way you came
Use gamma gamma as needed on plants you encounter on your way back to the server switch
Use the switch to leave the highland forest
Back at T your goal now is the labeled T T area switch above the upper left circular area
Take Lea up the left side of the outlined area and under the leftmost circle
About lights away from the switch to T T stop to save your game
Note Save your game before going farther
It will be a loooong time before you can save again

The Learner rsquo s Permit Approach tothe Highland Forest Omega Bubbles Involves T T and T Alternate to Original Approach Above Note that there are two server switches for T T at the bottoms of the circles
You want to use the closest switch but only briefly Activate the switch to enter the highland forest at location T
Lea has a flashback involving in trouble and she is certain she has been here before
Lea says that she can see a Combat Tyriades patrolling the area As soon as you can activate the switch toreturnto T
The game will now let you work your way through the southern portion of T to the server switch that takes you directly to T where the Omega pheromone plant is located
Work all the way around the circles until you are under the leftmost circle and then lead Lea south along the path leading down to another T T switch brings you in at location T
Turn on the camera at the bottom of the area and see the omega bubbles
Now Lea needs to work her way down in that direction
If you encounter plants enabling the pheromone function on the portable camera and using gamma gamma will still work on them
You may not be aware that a plant is blocking you ndash if you can rsquo t advance to the next light use gamma gamma and then see if clicking on the light allows you to advance
After you arrive at the bubbles Lea tries to take one but she is unsuccessful
Use ldquo Ecstasy rdquo alpha alpha at force to freeze the bubbles
Immediately use ldquo Desire rdquo beta beta at force or ldquo Enchantment rdquo delta delta and Lea grabs the omega pheromone
Now you need to leave the way you came
Use gamma gamma as needed on plants you encounter on your way back to the server switch
You may not be aware that a plant is blocking you ndash if you can rsquo t advance to the next light use gamma gamma and then see if clicking on the light allows you to advance
Before using the switch save your game
You could return to T but you just might want to explore the areas in the T part of the highland forest that you haven rsquo t seen yet And now that you have the omega pheromone this is a good opportunity to practice communicating with the Combat Tyriades before the stakes get higher you will need to be very good at communicating later in the game This is also the closest you will come to a Combat Tyriades and it rsquo s entertaining to take this close a look at them
Have Lea walk around through the rest of the highland forest hunting for Combat Tyriades for language practice in this non pressured situation
When you are ldquo talking rdquo to a Combat Tyriade you need to have the camera rsquo s pheromone bulls eye pointed in his direction so that a grey square appears around him
The pheromones that the Combat Tyriade is emitting will be in white squares near the bulls eye with the grey square around it
You will notice that these are the same symbols that are in the Language Pack
At the same time you rsquo ll see a colorful cloud streaming from the tyriade rsquo s head
You respond to the pheromones symbols by clicking on the symbols in your language pack and then sending them probably at force just as you did when communicating with the plants The difference is that here you will be responding to the tyriade rsquo s symbols rather than initiating symbols on your own
Your responses are recorded in white squares directly on top of the symbols from the Combat Tyriade
You rsquo ll see other symbols in white ndash dashes for instance
Dashes I think mean that the communication exchange had a neutral outcome
Plusses I think mean that you have elicited an emotional response NOT what you want here
Each Combat Tyriades will begin by asking you about your caste
If the tyriade asks You reply with AA BB BB AA For all other communication the strategy is to send back the same message with or without omega so that your reply is the opposite
For example If the tyriade asks You reply with B B A A Your response letters can be in any order
Working left to right can speed up the entry
If you fail at a particular communication sequence you rsquo ll see a brief ldquo flashback rdquo screen and then you rsquo ll be returned to the highland forest where you can hunt more tyriades for language practice
If you rsquo ve already talked to that particular tyriade the next time you talk your previous conversation will still be recorded in the gray square ndash just ignore this and respond to the new conversation
In case you are wondering what the tyriades are saying and what you rsquo re replying ndash once past the opening caste question here are some translations A Conciliating A Aggressive B Curious B Disrespectful E Exalted E Apathetic A Calm A Nervous EB Submissive EB Domineering Once you are comfortable with this form of communication you can either return to one of the activation switches that take you back to T
Or you can return to your saved game which will erase your experiences in the highland forest with the Combat Tyriades as far as the game is concerned anyway
Then use the nearest switch to leave the highland forest and return to T
Back at T your goal now is the labeled T T area switch above the upper left circular area
About lights away from the switch to T T stop to save your game
Note Save your game before going farther
It will be a loooong time before you can save again
The Rambling Flowers Continue toward the switch to T T
As Lea moves toward the activation switch before she can reach it she hears the threatening voice of Loyd and she is pushed into a gully with floating flowers
Lea needs to use the flowers to get out of the gully
Guirnisch rsquo s files refer to ldquo rambling flowers rdquo and indicate that beta beta or delta delta will move a flower toward the emission source
Choose the nearest flower and emit beta beta at force level
When the flower comes close Lea jumps in and is taken back to where the flower was
Wait for that to happen
Now choose the next close flower and repeat the process
Several flowers are needed to rise to the top
Hint The goal is to gain height not to try to get over to the side where Lea could get off of a flower and onto the path
Still in a flower Lea sees Loyd preparing a bomb
After the conversation between Lea and Loyd he runs off
Now Lea has a dream sequence in which Tyriades take her on a flower ride to the General Council
The Council of the Generals A human man tells Lea she must defend herself with the generals
Turn on the camera near the bottom of the map so you can see the arrangement of the generals
This will also allow you to see Lea as she turns to face them and to see which general is emitting pheromones
Hint Although Lea is nagging you can ignore her and use some time to practice moving the camera from general to general
Enable the Pheromone function on the portable camera Lea rsquo s shoulder cam
If you are having trouble because the camera viewpoint seems to constantly drift back under Lea rsquo s chin check to make sure that at the top of the portable camera window the ldquo automatic tracking rdquo icon is enabled
Note The most hideous part of this segment is the jerky camera
You can control it somewhat better by dragging it a little at a time and lifting your finger from the mouse
This will prevent the camera from swinging all around but you still need to learn to move the camera quickly
Since mouse movement is so important here you might want to go into the Options menu and see if moving the mouse sensitivity slider further to the right helps you with movement
Not being able to save during this segment is obnoxious but there it is
Finally if you give up on this segment and quit you should be able to restore with backup the automatic backup without having to go through the flowers thing again
Once you rsquo re oriented and ready to get started close down the map window and the second viewing window so that only the portable camera window and the Language Pack is open
Minimizing the window of the portable camera to the smallest size might make ldquo aiming rdquo the camera easier because you don rsquo t have to move the mouse as far
If the camera movement makes you feel nauseated the smaller window might also reduce the feeling of nausea
Move the language pack window and the portable camera window next to one another on the screen up high enough so that the subtitles won rsquo t interfere with them
When you are ldquo talking rdquo to a general you need to have the bulls eye pointed in his direction so that a grey square appears around him and the pheromones he is sending appear as symbols ndash you will notice that these are the same symbols that are in the Language Pack
For reference number the generals through counterclockwise starting with the general to the screen left of the man who seems to be presiding
When you have your bulls eye on a general a panel will open to show which pheromones he is emitting
You must reply by selecting the correct pheromones from the Language Pack and sending them at force level
Each general will begin by asking you about your caste
If the general asks You reply with AA BB BB AA For all other questions the strategy is to send back the same message with or without omega so that your reply is the opposite
For example If the general asks You reply with B B A A Your response letters can be in any order
Working left to right can speed up the entry
Note Look closely at the symbols on the language pack window ndash note that the ldquo A rdquo looks a lot like the triangle delta symbol
Since this sequence is timed it rsquo s easy in your hurry to mistake ldquo A rdquo for the triangle ndash make sure you don rsquo t confuse them
The pheromones that the general is emitting will be in orange squares to the right of the bulls eye you rsquo ve aimed at his chest
At the same time you rsquo ll see a colorful cloud streaming from his head
You respond to the orange pheromones symbols
Your responses are recorded in white squares directly on top of the orange symbols
You rsquo ll see other symbols in white ndash dashes for instance ndash but these aren rsquo t as important and you can ignore them
So far it seems that each of the five generals always opens with BB which means that you always respond with AA
If in your game the general opens with AA you rsquo ll need to respond with BB ndash make a note the first time you see each general rsquo s first set of ldquo caste rdquo pheromones because that will always be his first pheromone sequence and you need to know it in advance so you can answer it quickly
After you have answered the questions of general pan over to generals and
They seem to alternate
Note The only time you may get out of this exact sequence is if you make a mistake and send the wrong pheromone combination to one of the generals This doesn rsquo t necessarily mean failure ndash the general will sometimes give you a second chance
So for instance if you make a mistake with general it rsquo s possible by the end to have finished with general but still have to go back to respond to another pheromone question from general
When you take on generals and and are switching the camera back and forth between them don rsquo t wait for Lea rsquo s comments or to see if the general accepts your answer
Launch the pheromones and move the camera immediately to the next general enter the next sequence launch move launch move etc
When you have completed generals and the questions are asked by generals and
Again the questioning appears to cycle
Between the end of the generals sequence and the start of the generals sequence there is some conversation between Lea and the other human
Use this time to preload the upcoming response to general rsquo s caste you will probably be answering with AA and get ready to aim
Lea will say ldquo Three
That rsquo s a lot
Let rsquo s focus rdquo As soon as she finishes saying this look closely at general who should be starting to send out BB
Immediately send AA at him then without hesitating send AA at general and then AA at general
This is where the generals sequence is won or lost ndash if you don rsquo t send the opening responses ndash probably AA at all three generals as fast as you can Lea stops the sequence
Then return to general and see what pheromones he is sending
You rsquo ll have to respond to two more pheromone questions from each general but the timing for these seems a bit more generous
If you fail a sequence Lea sometimes let you know that you have failed
Other times the only way you will know that you have failed is that general suddenly is the only general sending you new pheromone combinations in that case he rsquo ll probably be sending BB over and over
You will then have to start the whole sequence again starting with general again then on to generals and and so on
Note If you have to start again this sometimes leaves old orange pheromone sequences at the top of generals to from the previous attempt because you didn rsquo t respond to them quickly enough for your response to register
Ignore these
Just go back to where general is sending you BB respond with AA and go from there
Defusing the Bomb After you have confused the generals there rsquo s more dialog and then Lea goes back to get some tools to defuse the bomb
Then you are automatically taken to where the bomb is
Lea will explain how you should communicate with her in order to defuse it
You have a couple of minutes to defuse the bomb
You rsquo ll need to use the language pack
You can look up the bomb drawings in Mike Loyd rsquo s files if you like which are somewhat helpful
There rsquo s also a close up window of the bomb that you can study
These things take time though and you don rsquo t have much at your disposal
It rsquo s possible that the bomb defusing sequence is randomly generated so that what works may differ for every game
Below is one sequence that worked
Sometimes Lea doesn rsquo t seem to respond even when you send the correct pheromones at her ndash sometimes I had to send them twice
You will be sending either Alpha A or Alpha and Omega ndash this time after entering the symbols you press the little ldquo O rdquo button to launch the pheromones
When Lea puts the wire cutters over the first wire a sort of brown color send Alpha Omega DON rsquo T cut
When Lea puts the wire cutters over the red wire send just Alpha DO cut
When Lea puts the wire cutters over the yellow wire send Alpha Omega DON rsquo T cut
When Lea puts the wire cutters over the green wire send Alpha Omega DON rsquo T cut
When Lea puts the wire cutters over the blue wire send just Alpha DO cut
The bomb is defused
You are then taken to the Ascending Abyss where you can finally save your game
Note If you fail to defuse the bomb all is not lost
You do have to find your own way to the Ascending Abyss ndash go to the nearest activation switch triangle the one north of your current position and click on it
The Wind Well This part of the game is mostly for observing the amazing location You go straight ndash on the map it looks like there rsquo s a crossroads but in fact it rsquo s made of bridge like paths that pass in the air and don rsquo t connect You can walk all around and eventually come back beneath the original bridge but perpendicular to it At the end of your path is a door You rsquo ll need a code XX K The Ascending Abyss Again there rsquo s just one direction in which you can walk You rsquo ll see Miilyan when you reach the end and you discuss matters Miilyan goes inside a central building You can walk around the building a bit taking in the sights There are two doors but it rsquo s hard to open them
On the map look down at the ldquo legend rdquo part and click on the ldquo lights rdquo icon This will eliminate all the light icons on the map revealing the two door icons on the map Click on one door icon and Lea will enter the building
Re enable the lights icon on the bottom of the map so you can see where the lights are in this new area
Again you have a conversation with Miilyan Lea automatically drops her language pack on the desk as instructed You get the last pheromone ndash Psi When this is done open up the language pack window by clicking on the tool bar on the pop up menu on the left of the screen Miilyan will explain more about the Ascending Abyss and how to communicate with it
When you are asked for symbols Psi should already be entered use these Delta Delta the two triangles ndash send at force level EB ndash emit at force level B ndash emit at force level Note If you failed to defuse the bomb earlier Miilyan will say that you must wait for the gas to dissipate You then wait for about a minute until she begins speaking again
In one playthrough the exploding bomb had no effect on the settings above ndash they stayed the same In another playthrough the gas from the exploding bomb caused one of the settings to change ndash the changed setting had to be figured out using trial and error
You rsquo ve reached the final puzzle
You need to enter a code in order to use the Ascending Abyss to get to rsquo s location The code is based on your trip parameters Miilyan gives you information Northwesterly winds average velocity Temperature at degrees slowly increasing Residual Moisture declining Stable pressure at millibars Go into Paul Guirnisch rsquo s sensitive files and look at the file for Travel Lists and Their Explanations
When interpreting the information in these lists look at the direction of the arrows not their color
The code works out to ndash click on the code interface and enter this code
