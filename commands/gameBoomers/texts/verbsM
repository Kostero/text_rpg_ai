If you read the message from your companion you know that there several sixteen in all mind boggling games created by the companions and hidden away or locked behind various puzzles
There is no actual introductory puzzle required to access this first game it was revealed by the storm
The first game you encounter in the game of Magnetic is based on the ancient game if Nim
As with several other games the ultimate object is to be the last player to have a turn
In this case it means being able to remove the last piece
This is a variation on the traditional game where the player forced to take the last piece loses
The rules are simple When it is your turn you may remove one two or three pieces
When it is the computer's turn the same rule applies
How the controlling device works If you decide you want to go first pull the lever toward yourself by clicking on the right edge of the wooden handle and dragging slightly to the right
If you want the computer go first instead pull the lever toward the playing field by clicking on the left edge of the wooden handle and dragging left
At your turn decide how many pieces you should remove and click on them
When you are satisfied with one or two click on the handle to make the computer take its turn
If you remove three the computer automatically takes its turn
If you have trouble working out the logic of this game click on the link below to see a description of the technique guaranteed to win every time
The logic behind a winning game is fairly simple
Since neither you nor the computer can take away more than three pieces you should plan to make the computer choose from agroup of four piecesat its final turn
Since it can't remove everything but is forced to take at least one you will be left with one two or three pieces at your turn and can win
But what to do when there are many pieces
Simply count them all and leave the computer withany multiple of fourat its turn
Four eight twelve or sixteen will work
Therefore if you see eight pieces at the start make the computer go first
If instead you see ten go first yourself and take away two leaving eight
Always finish your turns by leaving multiples of four and you are guaranteed to win
To find it Start at the Beach Bowling scene and go forward L F R You are faced with a x grid
Clicking on any square places a Queen on that square
The object of this puzzle is to place four queens so that each one occupies a unique row and column
If you place one that coincides with another already in place it knocks the first one away
Maddening isn't it
Actually the x is not too hard and it gives you some idea of how to discover a concept that will work with larger grids
X X X X A very similar pattern works for the x grid X X X X X X Now for the Biggie X X X X X X X X First the counters are divided into several heaps
At your turn you remove as many counters as you wish from one heap
You must remove a minimum of one counter from the heap and may remove the whole heap if you wish
In our game we don't have 'heaps' or 'rows' but colors
So you may remove any or all of the color you select
You may also force the opponent to go first if you desire
As before you want to control the removal of the pieces so that you get to take the last one leaving your opponent with no move
It helps to establish symmetry
Look for colors that are equal in number and remove all the pieces of the remaining color
For example you start with four blue four gold and three white
Take away the white ones
Then after you opponent moves restore the symmetry so he is left with equal numbers of each color
Keep doing that and you can win
To get to the Mancala Game you must solve another puzzle arranging sixteen coins
Look at the images
They represent a Castle a Knight on a horse a Bishop King Queen and a Foot Soldier Pawn
Set them up as a Chess Board layout
The trick is to nudge the big coins tightly together and align the pawns neatly over them
Aren't they beautiful
How to find it
From the No Fishing No Pets sign go forward three times
to get to the No Fishing sign start at the Beach Bowling scene
Turn right seven times then F R F L F
Once you solve the coins puzzle you have access to what is proclaimed to be theoldest game in the world
It is played all over Africa with various rules

Amazing
The rules of this game if you haven't figured them out are as follows The bowls on the bottom belong to you and the large bowl at the right is your goal
The primary object of the game is tocollect more pieces in your goalthan the opponent gathers in his
See the little 's
that tells you that you are beginning with four pieces in each bowl
When you select one of your bowls all the pieces in that bowl are picked up and distributed one at a time in the adjacent bowls
If the last piece distributed in a turn lands in the goal you get another turn
If the last piece distributed in a turn lands in an empty bowl and if the opponent's bowl opposite that one contains any pieces you capture those pieces and they all go into your goal along with the last piece you dropped
Once pieces are in either goal they are safe and cannot be lost
When either player completely clears his side all the pieces belonging to the other player go into the other player's goal
Thus it would be to your advantage to accumulate many pieces in one of your bowls and let the opponent clear the other side
Care must be taken to protect your stash by insuring that the opponent's bowl opposite your full one is never empty preventing their capture
You would do this by sending some of your pieces around to the far side at times
You go first so it would seem advantageous to select bowl three since the pieces will be dropped into four five six and the goal giving you another turn
Here are the first several moves to get you off to a good start
If you need to bail out and would like to see a complete winning sequence there are many more ways to win than this Click Here
One combination of moves that will get you through this game is this
Here's another one a little shorter but with fewer pieces to your credit
A win is still a win

High up on a hill is a box with a lever and five large buttons
Pressing any button results in a musical selection playing
The position of the five pieces is determined when you open the puzzle and will be different if you re open it and what's more they may be different pieces
There are several more than five to draw from
To find your way here start at the Wazzidor Bay sign
Turn left twice and climb the hill eight steps
Or from the Beach Bowling R F L F
The object of this puzzle is for you to memorize these five pieces by next Sunday afternoon when you will play them for an audience of at least people composed of your friends and family
Just kidding
You do however need to learn enough about these five musical selections to be able to identify them upon hearing them again
What you do is this Press the buttons as often as you like and try to distinguish between them
I know it's an advantage to be musical but even if you think you have a quot tin ear quot or call yourself tone deaf you can do this it just takes a little understanding
Listen to the tunes and try to apply your own adjectives to them
Pick out the loudest one for example and the softest one
Are any of them quot bangy quot or quot smooth quot or quot sad quot or quot jumpy quot or whatever quality you can think of
There are only five and I'm sure you can find a way to do it
Sorry because it's random I can't provide a firm answer
Once you think you can tell them apart pull the lever
One of the tunes will play and you must press the button that played that same music when you pressed it before
If you are correct another tune will play expecting you to press its button
If you get one wrong it starts over at the first one
Completing all five opens the next game in the tower atop the hill
The only way you cannot do this puzzle is if you are truly deaf and cannot hear the sounds at all
If that is the case you will have to enlist the help of a hearing person
There is not to my knowledge a short cut or cheat
As you start this game you will find that you have very little none that is control over where the pieces go
Even if you are good at this game you will lose at first
That's because quot you quot are the robot on the left and your opponent is the robot on the right
After losing four or five games the lamp in the belly of your robot will start to glow
Now you can open it and make some adjustments to the robot's settings
Find the stack of cards
You should spread them out with the least desirable pattern on the left and the most desirable pattern on the right
Now that the robot has been optimized you should have no trouble getting to eight wins even if the opponent happens to win one or two along the way
Arrange the cards in such a way so as to encourage a win and discourage a loss
Lots of arrangements will work just fine
The one pictured here seems to work pretty well
MapDraughts Checkers When you see the big White Birch tree against the rocks find the hotspot to open this image

To find this place start at the Beach Bowling location
Turn right seven times then F L F L You see a large rock that takes up most of the right half of the scene with some scrubby trees in the center and some patchy sun at the left
The spot is at the base of those trees down in the darkest part of the picture
Rules of the game Your pieces are white the opponent's red
You can only move diagonally and you cannot go backward unless you reach the opposite side of the board
If you are adjacent to an opponent's piece and the space beyond is open you capture the opponent by jumping over it
If a capturing move is available you must take it even if other moves are possible
One side wins by capturing all the other side's pieces
White goes first
This is a scaled down version of the original game where the board is x and each player starts with eight pieces
I have chosen not to elaborate on a series of moves this is not a particularly difficult game even though the computer plays it's best the human player can win
It's a big advantage to have the first move and the best move on this board is to choose the center piece first
The preliminary puzzle is one of the toughest and so it should be
The game that follows is equally difficult
To find it Start at the Beach Bowling scene and go F L F
High up on a hillside is a cute little tin box that originally contained some charming photos
Now it contains a brain busting puzzle wherein you must set up an equation to yield the desired result
There has been some discussion about the rules of sequence that is do you add first or multiply first and where are the parentheses when you need them
In any case if you have fiddled with the numbers at all your companion showed you a very important clue already
It probably came after you accidentally solved one of the eight formulae
He says quot Tricky
He started counting at zero quot Also the picture in the book reveals the settings that will produce zero
It reads By the way you will discover that you can use each numeral only once and the mathematical operators add subtract multiply and divide only once as well
I would prefer to write the above expression thus
The parentheses dictate to do that operation first so four divided by two is two then one plus two minus three is zero
Your job is to find mathematical expressions that equal all eight numbers from zero to seven
Once you have discovered them you must accurately
insert them in order
Need a spoiler for the expressions
I will assume you are being a sport and only want to see one at a time
Zero check your companion's book or see above
One thiks of it this way or Two x Picture it thus x Three x Remember multiply first x Four or this way Five x Multiply first x Six x or x x also works commutative property x or x Seven x also works commutative property x I don't understand why this one works
D'oh
This is a truly fascinating game I had not encountered before playing Magnetic
It is very old as are many of the games we encounter here
This one is of Irish origin
Here is an excerpt from a page describing the rules and strategy Unlike Chess or Checkers which are fought by armies from opposite sides of the board Tafl Fitchneal games involve a single king and his defenders in the center of the board surrounded by an army of attackers twice their number
The basic rules are that the defender starts with the king in the very center of the board and defended by his pawns or guards
The defender wins if the king is able to break the siege byescaping to the edgeof the board or to a corner hole in some variations
The attacking army wins by surrounding the king onfour sidesto capture him
All of the pieces move any number of spaces left or right or up or down in the same manner as a rook in Chess
quot Pawns quot may be captured by trapping them between two of your own pieces
Magnetic's version of this game is interesting because you can choose to be the attackers or the defenders
It turns out you arebetter off defending because the options allow you a slight edge
Here is the original setup Isn't that amazing
There are twice as many attackers as defenders but the defense has an edge
Some brilliant Viking understood the value of protection

There seems to be some vague connection between this game and Nine Men's Morris which I consider to be a much more difficult game only because of it's apparent simplicity and actual variables
N M M is Tic Tac Toe XOX for masochistic grownups and gets my vote for the most difficult board game around given a skilled opponent
In fact in the adventure game quot Drowned God quot the developers actually had to build in a weakening of the opponent predicated on several losses by the player or it would have been impossible to surpass
Anyway down to business
There are many paths to success in Fitchneal and it's fun to play
I encourage you to experiment and learn something about the strategy Click hereif you want to see one winning pattern
Label the colums from left to right A B C D E F G H I Label the rows from bottom to top It doesn't matter if you label it backwards the board has four way symmetry
Make these moves E C E C D D F F E E E D C C D C C B C B C A OR C Turtle Puzzle To find it From the No Fishing No Pets sign turn left and go forward once
to get to the No Fishing sign start at the Beach Bowling scene
Turn right seven times then F R F L F
See how the Turtle has three missing scutes on his shell
You have to solve three puzzles to make the missing scutes reappear and complete the shell
Then you can proceed to the Hexagon game
Click on the turtle
You will see a pattern develop above the turtle and another pattern develop above the control box
Your job is to adjust the control box settings so that its pattern matches the one created by the turtle
Starting at the left the first button sets the color
Red Yellow Dark Blue Orange Green Purple White and Cyan light blue
The second button chooses the basic shape
Octagon Hexagon Pentagon Square Triangle Star and Straight line
The third button controls the number of repetitions being the most and being the least
The fourth button causes the image to rotate as it renders
is the most to the left is no twist and is the most to the right
I cannot provide an absolute set of answers because they change from game to game
You will simply have to learn the functions and make the adjustments
It's not hard to do but just wait 'til you get into the game that follows
Aaarghh
To tell the truth I had trouble coming up with any solid strategy
One player provided the following suggestion and it seems to give you enough advantage to win
Place your first piece in the second row second column from the top
If you label the Orange side A B C D E F left to right and the Blue side top to bottom your starting spot is B
You will notice that the computer most often starts in C
Work your way down trying to keep a double option open as you go
This means you might have to use column C sometimes
Notice at the top how you have the choice of B or A
Use the same idea as you approach the sixth row making it so you have two places to go such as B and C
With the double choice you can't be blocked
Thanks quot Sillerk quot for the advice
To find it From the No Fishing No Pets sign go forward once and turn left
to get to the No Fishing sign start at the Beach Bowling scene
Turn right seven times then F R F L F
Click on the rock to begin a randomized puzzle
Observe that when you click on one of the spaces whether it is glass or gold empty or full
it and all it's neighbors change their state
Your goal in this puzzle is to change all the spots to gold
It's pretty easy once you understand the hints
Look to the lower right of the screen and underneath the arrow is a book containing the following five pages
What you need to do is start at the top working your way downwards to the bottom
Use the second row to change the spots in the first row and use the third row to fix the second row and so on
Do this until the first four rows are completed and you are left with one of the above patterns
Notice that the third and fourth pattern are reversible because they are not symmetrical
See also that the first and second patterns show two places encircled at the top
This means that you may select either one they both work
Having identified which pattern you have arrived at start again at the top row beginning with the item circled
If you then complete the rows in order from the top down you will arrive at the bottom with a pattern that allows you to complete the sequence
The five patterns above cannot be completed by fiddling with the bottom one or two rows you must establish parity by starting correctly at the top
Each time you finish the pattern the cavern to your right opens a little more
The object of this game is for you to end up owning more boxes than your opponent
There are available squares so any time you can take thirteen or more you will win and whenever your opponent has already taken or more you will lose
It begins with some of the line segments in the x grid already selected
If you can find any boxes with three sides already selected select the fourth and take possession of that box now
If you don't do it your opponent will
In the beginning you should avoid selecting a segment that will provide a three sided box it's a give away to your opponent
When a player completes a box he goes again and again and again as long as there are three sided boxes available
As the game progresses and quot safe quot segments beecome harder to find you will eventually have to provide your opponent with some squares
Examine the layout and figure out ways to give away the least
If you can find a two sided square where providing the third side will allow the opponent to take that box but not be able to continue with a string of others that's the best move
Likewise look at the other strings
If you must choose between giving away three squares or five obviously it's a better choice to give away the three and force your opponent to give you the five
To find this area start at the Beach Bowling
Turn R F R The preliminary puzzle to the Pin Balls is the Wazzidor Bay Lookout color puzzle
Clicking on the Word quot Wazzidor quot scrambles the colors in the word
It is up to you to arrange the colors according to a clue you found on a small piece of paper elsewhere To find the paper clue start at the Beach Bowling scene
Turn right seven times then F L F L F and look in the fallen tree
The sequence of colors was randomly selected especially for you so you must locate that piece of paper in order to solve the puzzle
Hint Think like Noah's Ark two by two
Solving the puzzle results in the hillside opening to your left
The paper clue will not change during your game however if you start a whole new game with a different companion the order of the colors will be a new selection and you must locate the clue anew
The object of this game is to accumulate eight balls on your side before the opponent does
Clicking on any one of the four balls at the top causes that ball to tumble through the levers until it either reaches bottom or lands on a platform
If the next player sends a ball downward so as to trigger the lever where your ball is resting then both balls will fall
If a player sends a ball down in such a way as to land on top of a ball sitting on a platform both balls will also fall until one or both reaches bottom or gets trapped on another platform
If either player at his turn gets the ball he released along with all that had been sitting on any platforms he gets another turn
Notice the symmetry in the levers here
The two in the left column are both to the left the two middle ones are both left and the ones in the right column are also the same
Whether they are left or right is unimportant so long as both levers in each column match
With this configuration you are guaranteed to win
Here you would drop the third ball causing the middle and right levers to all change
Then both the second and fourth balls will drop clear through
Since you go first and you each drop one ball at a time you get the eighth ball before your opponent
Now it's fun to beat the computer starting with any pattern but it's darned hard in my opinion
There's a way you can rack up eight wins but it's not very sporting
If you develop any ability for this game have at it and enjoy
If you reach your frustration limit and simply want to trudge through eight boring games
Since you know how to win when the levers in each column match you want to always start that way
How to do it
Do not back out of the game using the right mouse button
Instead go to the top left of the screen and open the transporter
Transport directly back into the Pinball game through the transporter
This way you do not lose credit for the games you have won
Keep transporting back in until you see the pattern where you know you can win
Boring but it works
To find it Start at the Beach Bowling scene
Turn right seven times then F
You must assemble seven blocks to create a cube
If you place a cube in the wrong sequence they all jump back to the starting point
It's a puzzle
C'mon now you can figure it out
If you just cannot To solve the cube choose the pieces in this order Light BluePurplePinkDark BlueYellowOrangeGreen
The first two are reversible the others must come in order
The object of this game is to ensure that you have thefinal turn by placing your orange blocks so as to prevent the computer from placing any more
Your blocks are always horizontal and your opponent's are always vertical
The general strategy is to create and save a horizontal spot for last while obstructing the opponent so he can't do the same thing to you
You always go first so your first position is very important
Experiment with the x grid
If you start in a corner you always lose and if youstart in the center row you always win
The x is not so obvious
If you start on any edge you will lose
Instead start on an inside block for example row column
You will be able to beat the opponent this way
Here's a couple of examples with one move to go
The pattern can take several variations but the idea remains the same
Here's some suggestions for the x grid
Start again in the second row
The remaining and grids are a struggle to be sure but apply the knowledge you have learned by getting through the x and you will make it

Peter is working on a variation for non English speakers
This game is a variation of the popular board game Scrabble except that you only have one letter at a time to place and the tiles have no point value
You alternate placing letters with the computer opponent
Your score comes when you create a word
It is a big advantage if you create crossing words for you get points for both of them
I found it frustrating that so many words I tried should be valid words but received no score because they are not in the lists available to the computer
Peter explained to me that he didn't want the computer to come up with a lot of unusual words
All it takes to win is a final score larger than your opponent
You may think since it is a x board that once you or your opponent gets to the game is over but not so
Because of the cross scoring feature it is possible to reach surprising sums and it quot ain't over 'til it's over quot After you solve a puzzle where you fit odd shaped pieces together to form a square you will enter a darkened chamber

How to find the Beach Bowling
The hot spot is not active until you have seen the clue that shows you where it is
Solve the Dissected Square
The bowling game is right next to the first game Two Dimensional Nim
As with many other games in Magnetic the object is for you to take away the last piece
You can choose to go first the gold ball is yours or make the computer go first by clicking on the blue ball
You and the computer can strike one pin directly or two adjacent pins by bowling between them
You must decide who goes first by examining the pattern of the pins
Let's look at an example Remember the Nim game where you won by leaving the computer with multiples of four
You can use a somewhat similar tactic in this game except it's not the absolute numbers that matter it's the symmetry
What that means is there should bematching groupswhen it's the computer's turn to go
In the above setup there are two groups of two that's good leave them alone and a group of three and a group of four
This time you should go first and pick a pin from the end of the group of four changing it into a group of three
It isnot the positionof the groups that matters it's theequal numbers
If the starting setup contains equal groups make the computer go first
Whatever it does you will be able to restore the symmetry at your turn
If all fifteen pins are there at the start you should go first and remove the center one leaving seven and seven
For starters count the total number of pins visible
If it is an even number make the computer go first
Then deal with the pattern
There is another approach you can take but it's not very sporting
For those who have reached their frustration limit and simply want to forge through the bowling game Click Here to see a spoiler
Don't bother trying this technique until you understand how to handle the symmetry
If you don't like the pattern you see you can re set the pins this way Do not back away from the puzzle by right clicking
Instead go to the transporter at the upper left open it and re enter the bowling game directly
This way you will not sacrifice any wins you have already achieved
Examine the new pattern to determine if it is symmetrical or if you can make it symmetrical in one move
If this is true you can proceed to win
If you don't understand the new pattern or if you know it's a losing proposition transport in again to see a new pattern

To find the Tessellation puzzle start at the Beach Bowling and turn right five times
From Merriam Webster Tessellation a MOSAIC b a covering of an infinite geometric plane without gaps or overlaps by congruent plane figures of one type or a few types
Here's one complete element of the repeating pattern First of all Pawns can only move forward
The white ones are yours
If a Pawn is sitting on the first row it has the option of moving one square or two squares
If it is anywhere else it can only move one square
Unlike a Chess game these Pawns cannot capture one another
They can only block
The object of this game is totake the last moveby blocking the opponent so he has no move
As a general strategy save your possible double moves for lastbecause they give you flexibility
Block each opponent's Pawn with single moves whenever possible
Somewhere along the trail you picked up this crumpled piece of paper
It is a clue to help you figure out the combination to this keypad on what looks like it used to be an anvient Foman fountain To find the clue start at the Beach Bowling and turn right seven times
Then F To get to the fountain from the clue go B R F L F R To get to the clue from the fountain go L B R B L F Did you already solve the Numerical Sequences puzzle
If so you have a pretty good idea how to figure out the correct number
Figure out how the numbers are generated then come up with the next one in sequence
Here's the answer The numbers are generated by multiplying each sucessive one by increasing integers
One times two times three etc
You could use your Windows calculator
Finally times
The result is As usual you want to plan your moves in this game in order to have the last move
Sometimes you get the opportunity to win in one move
What you are looking for is a path containing anodd numberof steps leading to adead end
At times there is no such path and you must try to create one as you make your way across the board
The computer is pretty smart and will always make the best choice
There will be times when you get trapped and there is nothing you can do about it
To find this puzzle start at the Beach Bowling and turn right seven times
Then F R F L F L Pull the lever to switch on the power and turn left
The object of this puzzle is to remove the blocks in pairs by clicking where like colors meet
Try to plan ahead so that removal of a pair will result in two more similar colors bumping together
The arrangement is random each time you start
For example in the above arrangement see the two orange blocks in the middle
Clicking there will take out the blue orange and orange green dominoes
That will allow the purple red and red blue ones to abut
Then if you take those two out the purple purple and purple orange ones will meet
The point is study the arrangement a little before you start clicking away and plan it a little
The objective is to have the last move
That also means exactly filling the vessel with no more no less
The paint cans are arranged according to capacity
The nearest row of cans are gallons or pints or liters or gills or flagons or cups whatever then four then three then two and finally one
The computer selects a container at random for the first move
Then it is up to you to choose quantities that will lead to you having control over the last two moves
What you should strive for is to fill the container to leaving exactly six remaining
That way the computer must choose anything from one to five leaving you in range to fill it on your next move
As it was in the Nim game keeping multiples of six in mind gives you an advantage
So if the opponent puts in four to start with you should add two making six
Oops it's not quite that simple if one of the rows of cans happens to be used up and it's the one you need
For example it has gone
Now the total is and you would like to put in three to make but the 's are all used
You don't want to pour in or then the computer will be able to reach exactly
Try putting in one and see what happens

Then give her thepagesigned by R that you found under the clay jar
She knows now how much she hurt him
Lastly she wants proof about your own love
Give her thephotothat you found in the Geimann art gallery
Then give her your journal
Eshana is convinced that all this while she was loved and she lets Martin go
He returns to his normal life a sadder but hopefully wiser person

PURGATORY ENDING You only get this ending if you have a game score of more than points
You can see your points under the Info button on the toolbar
Give Eshana the two pieces of proof about her mother
When she demands proof about the painter Robert don rsquo t do anything
Martin tries to tell Eshana that he is sorry
Eshana asks him to stay with her
ldquo I won rsquo t leave you rdquo Martin agrees to give up his life to stay with her in the eternal darkness

ESHANA rsquo S DEATH ENDING There are many ways to get this ending but the easiest way is just to use theknifeon Eshana when you get the chance
Eshana staggers backwards in shock
Martin has stabbed her with the knife
But then her eyes flash and Martin is suddenly jerked backwards by the ropes
The ropes cut into him strangling him
In the end you see Eshana rsquo s body in a pool of blood on the floor and Martin rsquo s lifeless body dangling from the ceiling
MARTIN rsquo S DEATH ENDING Again there are many ways to get this ending but the easiest way is to just wait and do nothing after you meet Eshana
She will be convinced that you never cared about her
Martin is pulled into the air by the ropes
Flash to the real world an apartment block Martin is lying at the foot of a staircase with some people gathered around him
A man asks him if he is all right
Martin gets up
His face is hidden

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
I landed near one of the canals
The water is clear and flows faster than I thought it would
I turned around and walked away from the canal toward high canyon walls
I could see Chi through a breach in the canyon wall
No wonder this place stayed unexplored
It lies on the floor of a hidden canyon perhaps with only one entrance
I noticed there were side routes branching to the left and right
I'll explore those later if I have to Transport BuildingSome of the Martian machinery though neglected for centuries still works
As I approach the city buildings their doors open for me
I entered the first building on the right that I came to
It contains a device that looks a great deal like my ship's transporter
Unfortunately it's locked
It seems obvious to me that manipulating the nine tiles with Martian symbols on them near the transporter will operate it
The same symbol frames the bottom row and the right edge Dome BuildingWhile exploring a large domed building to the west of the transporter building I found a console with Martian writing on it
I couldn't translate it without the scanner
I went back to the ship for it I should have brought it with me from the start
It translated the Martian symbols on the console into numbers
And I recognized the Martian symbol for the number
I'd seen it before repeated many times on the tile grid in the transporter building
This suggests the tile grid must require the numbered tiles to be placed so that the columns rows and diagonals add to Return to Transport BuildingArmed with the knowledge that the tile grid puzzle in the transporter building was a number puzzle
To activate it all the rows columns and diagonals have to add to
I attempted to solve the puzzle using logic
For example I have concluded that the number must go in the center space and I believe that the number cannot go in a corner
I will try to devise a complete solution in my Working Notes
Also translating the symbols from the console in the Dome Building I have learned that the tiles are arranged in numerical order in their initial positions
Tile numbers through are in order in a vertical column to the left of the grid and tiles through are in order in a vertical column to the right of the grid
Using the transporter took me to the roof of the building where a Martian sand yacht is moored
However I found nothing on the yacht except some stored images
This is odd
Why was the transporter so carefully locked if there is nothing of value here StendahlI've seen a ghost or something
I don't know what it was
I couldn't record it with the data recorder
Was it really there or was it a figment of my imagination
It looked like a Martian strolling through the city
It suddenly appeared and then it just vanished
I explored the large building in the middle of the city
This is the building built by that moral degenerate Stendahl
If it weren't for the scanner I could never have made it through all six rooms or even from the first room to the second
To the naked eye and the unguarded mind there are no doors between one room and the next
But the scanner showed me that what I saw as impenetrable walls were really some kind of illusion
The house is full of eerie sounds ghostly projected images tricks and traps
I found a crystal fragment inside a skull in one room
All of the doors from room to room allow passage in one direction only never allowing me to retrace my path
I could only go forward always seemingly into a trap
Was Stendahl trying to protect his accursed books or was the house intended for more sinister purposes
In the Working Notes I have kept track of the steps that led me successfully through the house
The library in this house is a scandal
It contains hundreds of banned books
Among them I found an interesting book about a binary numbering system
I think I can use this information in the jail because the force field in the jail seems to be controlled by a binary lock JailA building on the north edge of the city contains a force field
It looks like it was built to be a jail
There's a Martian control panel on a pedestal next to it
The controls consist of six vertical bars
Each of them can be either up or down
Some setting of the six bars should shut the force field off
Fortunately the book in the library of the Stendahl house helped me figure this mechanism out
The code sequence is based on a variation of the binary number system
Successfully moving all of them to the down position will release the force field
On the first move only the left most bar is moveable
Clearly one must start by moving the first bar
On each successive move only one other bar besides the one just moved will move
Thus the problem can be worked by trial and error provided that I remember the rule never to move the same bar twice in a row
After moves all of the bars will be in the down position
Most of the bars will have been moved between the up and down positions many times during this move sequence but only at the end of the sequence will all six of the bars be down Return to Sand YachtIn the jail I found the log of another human explorer
It told of a crystal he had found and lost again in a Sand Yacht
Emerging from the jail I saw a sand yacht flying over the city
It landed on the roof of the Transporter Building
Is this another Martian hallucination from the past
Is this city or something in it affecting my mind causing me to see things that aren't here
Is it a distortion of time itself
Or did a sand yacht really go by
I could not resist returning to the Transport Building and using the transporter again
There seemed to be no change in the sand yacht moored there but when I scanned its control panels I saw a hidden crystal fragment
Once I scanned it the crystal was easy to obtain
It is another part of the key to the Archives Art GalleryTo the east of the jail is a building I call the Art Gallery because it has a number of Martian paintings in it
It also has a sliding tile mechanism
The tiled image when completed correctly is a map of the tunnels leading to the Archive that holds the Tx Hllt Hja
The tunnel map is the same as the tunnel map that I saw in the Power building
When the puzzle is solved the gap in the puzzle is located one square above the lower right corner rather than in the lower right corner itself
Since this mechanism scrambles the tiles randomly each time it is activated I have not been able to record a specific sequence of moves in my notes
After completing the map I discovered that there is a crystal hidden behind the map which I found by scanning
It could not be seen on the scanner until the map was correctly assembled Cave DwellingOn the western outskirts of the city is a cave
It seems to have been inhabited at one time
The artifacts there are Martian
Upon the cave wall I found a crystal
When I touched it five crystals appeared in a pattern of a horizontal rectangle with a fifth point centered above the rectangle
Two of the crystals highlight in sequence and a line appears connecting those two
I found that when I touched a correct point the point highlighted briefly and a line appeared connecting the last connected point with the point I just touched
When I touched an incorrect point the point highlighted briefly and the last line added to the figure disappeared setting the diagram back one step
When the diagram was complete an image appeared but I do not know what it means FragmentsWhile exploring Xi I have found Martian energy crystals
I detect them with the scanner
My helmet confirms what they are and when I choose to acquire them they're energy automatically charges my energy cells
Using this Martian energy hasn't adversely affected my equipment and it does allow me to spend more time in the city without having to return to the ship
I've also found some unusual crystal fragments that when analyzed proved to be pieces of some kind of key
One of these pieces was located in a sand yacht which was parked on the roof of the transportation building
When I solved the transporter puzzle the transporter was activated and when I entered it it transported me to the roof
I had to assemble the key in order to determine whether or not it or what it unlocks posses a threat to the morality of humankind
After finding all four pieces I brought them back to the rocket's tool kit
There I manipulated them into position
I now understand the significance of the image from the cave dwelling it is a view of the four Archive Key fragments correctly oriented for re assembly
To assemble the fragments I first rotated them so that their flat sides faced me
Then I rotated each piece clockwise or counterclockwise so that the smooth edge faced out toward the walls of the analyzer and the jagged edges faced in
I had to rotate some pieces to flip them over so that all the jagged edges would face in
I oriented the longer pieces first and then the squarer ones
When the four pieces were oriented correctly they pulled themselves together and became one solid crystal SpenderI've run into a madman named Spender
He claims to know the secrets of the universe
He threatened to kill me if I attempted to find the Tx Hllt Hja
He kept talking about a secret archive
I assumed that the key I have assembled has something to do with it
He told me he knew I had the key and he'd kill me for it
He was raving
Something about protecting the archive destroying and scattering the key
I shot him
But he was only wounded and got away
He stalks me now
I catch sight of him sometimes
I fear he has abducted the missing members of my team and may have taken them to this archive The ArchiveI found the opening to the archive
From the middle of the city in front of the steel gate posts I walked as far east as I could go
When I reached the canyon wall I turned south
I went on as far as I could until I was blocked by canyon wall then I turned east
The opening to the archive was hidden in the canyon wall
I touched the door and it opened
Beyond the door was a tunnel maze
I hate mazes but it could have been worse that maniac Spender could have been in there hunting me
I finally came to a large chamber
It contained consoles of the kind I'd seen in other parts of the city
I was running out of energy and faced with the decision to investigate the consoles or investigate the door at the back of the room I choose to go through the door
The room had four display cases in it
One contained a purple crystal on a stand a Martian Singing book
I stood before the display case covered with Martian symbols and touched them one at a time
Each symbol I touched produced a musical tone
There were four triangular spaces next to the Martian key pad
Maybe only those four symbols which would appear in the four triangles are needed to obtain the all important secret that Spender is so obsessed with
The buttons are shaped like Martian glyphs but the glyphs have no particular meaning
That is it has no particular meaning to a human
Archeologists have determined that books like this are musical instruments
It was as familiar to Martians as a piano is to humans
I assumed that playing the correct notes on the book would cause something to happen
Martian melodies were composed of tone pairings
Tones were carefully selected and combined by the musician to create a pair
Then pairs were used to compose songs
The order of a pair is significant
Do re is not the same as re do
I hit random keys on the keyboard and by accident must have made a Martian pair
One of the triangles lit up showing a Martian glyph
I fumbled around trying to light more triangles
After hitting the keyboard times the Book pushed me away
By continued experimentation I have found the correct notes to reveal all four glyphs
I've recorded this in my working notes
When the triangles are lit each one shows one glyph making a sequence of four from top to bottom when all four triangles are lit
The glyph shown in each lit triangle and thus the sequence of four is always the same
This suggests that the four glyphs in exactly that order have some meaning
Because the glyphs do not represent letters or words they cannot be translated
It is possible that they are the notes of another song
As of this writing no conclusive evidence has been found which would identify what the four note song meant
However the title of the chant which produces them has been translated as Revelation
In a small room beyond the large one was another display case topped with a row of blank rectangles
I was certain that the fact the Singing Book would yield four glyphs and that this strange case could accommodate four glyphs was not a coincidence
I also concluded that this case must hold the thing that Spender is so concerned about
The significance of the earth objects in their display case eludes me for the moment
But the significance of the song from the Singing Book is clear
The four glyphs can be used to unlock the final case
Since I do not know what this case will reveal and am almost out of energy I am returning this log to my ship
I will leave it there and return to open the case GAME BOOMER'S Hints Cheats and Walkthroughs

If timed successfully the rail guard rises in time to get the train to pass through and enter the tunnel to the next room Hint Fill the bucket and then empty it
Slow down the drip of water and when the train is heard coming raise the drip to maximum
With practice the timing can be refined to time the raising of the rail guard and the train's arrival
Climbing the beanstalk Clock and plant Go back to the alarm clock and the plant
Whenever you hear the cuckoo while at the train station the plant has grown a little
When the plant reaches way high the alarm of the clock will ring
You might need to go and check other rooms while waiting for the plant to grow high enough
Also practice climbing the plant as it grows
The blue glove will appear when it is the correct time and it will help you climb the plant to get the missing paper from this room
Climb the plant Jack
How to get the missing page Best save the game when the plant is already off the screen and before the blue glove appears at
If the alarm goes off the plant has reached its highest growth and if the page is not successfully taken after a while the plant will grow small and needs to grow again before another try can be done
Once the blue glove holds the stem immediately hold the stem higher than the blue glove until you reach the flower stem part
Pull down the screen by click hold move the mouse up and down to see the rest of the plant up off the screen Hint Hold the screen down as long as possible to give the blue glove time to jump and grab the missing page
Room of Electricity From steam to electricity The room can be accessed from the storybook and from a picture at the room of Light
The other exit is on the plug of the mixer under the table
It is a flashing white line when the cursor passes over it
If the battery is not sent here yet from the Room of Time you will find a note from Grandfather Time to his granddaughter the Mistress of Electricity on the floor on the left side of the room
If the battery was sent here from the Room of Time the train comes in and drops the battery
Twirl the ring on the floor to get electricity flowing through the battery
Check the light bulb on the battery to see if it is charged
Check every so often if the battery needs charging
Fun stuff in the room Press down the connector on the left bottom of the screen to see the musical dancer turn
While doing the wire maze puzzle the eyes of the Mistress of Electricity moves
The clown on the right of the room gets electrified and tries to distract you while the puzzle is being done
Circuit Table Move back and see the circuit table
There is a box with a loose nail on the left foreground
The circuit of electricity has to be completed in order for the ledge with a fakir under the circuit table to rise
The ledge with the fakir will then get the missing page
The battery by the ring has purple blue cable on its negative pole and red on its positive pole
The battery's purple blue cable is attached to a metal rod which in turn has the red handled loop attached on it
The red handled loop must then connect to the nail at right end of the circuit table
The nail at right end of the circuit table is attached to a purple blue cable hanging from the table
The purple blue cable must then be attached to the motor that is on the right side under the table
At middle is a fakir on a ledge with gears and on the left are an Arabian tent and a mixer
How to get the loop Go forward to the top of the circuit table
On the circuit table is a red handled loop attached to the battery below
You have to move the loop through the metal mazewithouttouching its sideto free it from the maze
At right end of the maze is a metal rod barrier that flips up when electricity is not flowing through the metal maze
It flips down when the loop touches the metal closes the metal maze and the loop will not be removed from the maze
Move the loop and rest it on the purple insulated part of the metal maze on the left
Left click and hold the mouse to move the loop up and across the metal rod
Left click without holding down the mouse will turn the loop sideways to pass through each corner of the metal maze
If you touch the side you have to go back to the purple insulated metal rest on the left to raise the metal rod barrier on the right again and start over
The clown in the background will distract you by blowing his horn so watch out Hint Align the bar of the loop handle to the metal maze like tracing the metal maze with the loop's bar
Turn the loop at an angle that is diagonal to the corners for easier turn of the corners
If successful in not touching the side release the loop from the metal maze andgo up and over the raise metal rod barrier
The nail on the right will flash
Drop the loop over the nail
If you pull out the loop without going over the rod and did not see a flash on the nail the loop will not be able to be dropped on the nail
Just go back to the space between the rod and the maze and go over and place it over the nail on the table
Forkfuls of sparks To complete the circuit Move back and place the loose nail found in the box on the left to connect the nails with red cables attached to them on the table in the foreground
The nail will be placed at bottom of the left and top of the right cabled nails
Elevating with electricity Get the missing page Then go forward under the table
Try attaching both hanging cables on the mixer on the left after all of the above has been done and acloverleaf will be earned
The motor to run the ledge where the fakir is sitting on is on the right
To raise the ledge attach the purple blue cable to the motor's left prong and the red cable to the right prong
The ledge goes down if the cables are attached the other way around
The fakir will rise to the ceiling and take the missing page
Try raising the fakir again after you have taken the page and the fakir will fall down hanging from a bungee rope
Room of Warmth Twirl the ring in the foreground to light up the kitchen
Take the cat food and shake it releasing the ball behind it and acloverleaf will appear Exit The exit to the storybook is the glass with an umbrella and straw on the floor
The timer can be turned and the rooster crows
The timer is also an exit to the rail guard at the room of time
The forks and spoons on the stove is an exit to the room of electricity
Playing with fire Turn the stove on Go forward to the matchbox by the open window
Get a match and strike it on the matchbox to light it
Carefully move it to the gas stove on the right to light the stove
You will burn your hand if you wait too long Hint Time the lighting of the match when the wind dies down and move quickly to the timer to protect the match from the gust of wind
In moving from matchbox to timer tilt the match so that the flame is lower
Watch the arrow of the wind chime to gauge the wind gust
When the wind dies down a little bit move it to the stove on the right while having the flame a little higher
There is no saving of game possible here
Once the stove is lit get another match and light it using the stove's flame and earn acloverleaf
Lumpy Pancakes Cook pancakes Go to the stove top
Scoop pancake batter to the frying pan
You have to cook both sides of the pancakes by flipping the pancakes back into the pan
Shake the pan if the pancakes are cooked on both side they can be moved to the plate on right side
The blue glove will check if they are good or not
If not done in a set of time the flame goes out and you have to go through the match puzzle and the pancake puzzle again
No saving of game can be done here Hint Light the stove pour batter on pan and wait until the pancake turns brown
Take the frying pan move it over the red switch at the center of the stove and flip the pancake to turn it over
Wait until the other side gets cooked light brown and then flip the cooked pancake into the plate at right side
If correctly done the blue glove will transform it to a marvelous looking rolled pancake with trimmings and syrup
To get the missing page When the pancake puzzle is correctly done pull back away from the stove and see the blue glove go to the hot air balloon on the left
Take the warmth ring in the foreground and wave it on the balloon to lift it up
Adjust the amount and position of warmth ring you introduce to the hot air balloon's opening to get it up to the ceiling where the missing page is located
Move the balloon using the warmth ring so that the blue glove can grab the page up
The Garden of Chance Now that you've collected all the missing pages and have collected as many clover leaves as you can preferably all clover leaves read the story of the Garden of Chance to learn all about the missing cat and what must be done
So that is what happened to the missing cat the ever present ball
If you do not have enough clover leaves you can go back and go through each room and collect them by doing different tasks as seen above
I don't think a saved game can be done in this chapter
To get to the home of the Garden of Chance See a picture of a platform in the midst of a garden pond surrounded by the clover leaves you have collected
The more leaves the easier the different tasks will be
Jump into the platform
A task must be done correctly juggling balancing catching fireflies catching falling light bulbs to get to step on a chance rock on the other side of the platform
The chance rock will cycle to different selections to move forward or back depending on how well you did the task or what the die rolled
The more items done in one task more light bulbs more fireflies longer balancing etc the farther the rock moves
Red die Throw the red die on the rock and the number seen will be the number of moves the rock will do to get to move forward
From the platform will get to next platform and will get to the next chance rock
The higher the die number is the better
Forward arrow automatically get on next platform and do another task
Back arrow moves back to platform you just left
Target moves to back to the beginning
There are platforms yin yang toss coin rock and then a boat to get to the hut
Go to the hut and the classic shell game is to be done using the magic hats and the cat ball
Select the correct hat the ball is under in and the ball will be turned to the missing cat
GOOD LUCK
I found the cat under the left hat
I don't know if that will work for you

The Messenger Louvre The Ultimate Curse Index France Telecom Multimedia Canal Multimedia Walkthrough by MaGtRo February My dear daughter Morgane I will probably be dead when you discover this message
During the excavation of the Louvre I've discovered a lion shaped ewer and some engraved ivory tablets
It has taken me years to decipher them
It would seem the author was Anselme de Beauvais a th century wizard
Listen to me carefully
At that time Philippe the Good destroyed the order of the Temple
He seized their treasures and burned the Templars at stake
Some of them the Black Templars swore to avenge themselves and sold their souls to the devil
They forced Anselme to cast a spell on four objects based on the four elements of the Apocalypse which they called Satan's Keys
A bull a vase with an eagle on top a statue of an Assyrian demon and a Persian ewer in a shape of a lion
Once brought together these cursed objects will bring chaos and destruction to the earth
Such is the Templar's revenge
It seems that Anselme stole the ewer from them the one that I discovered
I know that the Black Templars Brotherhood is still in existence
They are looking for the four objects and they want the ewer that is shown in Louvre
I always said that it was dangerous to leave them in a simple glass cabinet
These fanatics are always seen as harmless cranks
Morgane you now have a risky job
Go to the Louvre get the ewer and destroy it
You'll at least have done one thing for me in your life

They became ghosts because of the practice of black magic on their bodies by the descendants of Anselme
Sombreval tricked everybody for centuries in the pursuit of the brotherhood
In fact he acted alone and the brotherhood of the Black Templar did not exist
Anselme stole the lion and King Philippe's men stole the other from the Templars

WARNING Please note that this walkthrough is copyrighted Hence anyattempt to reproduceanythingfrom this walkthrough will beseverelypunished to themaximumextent of the law
INTRODUCTION I started playing computer games some five years ago and have playedseveralsince then While I loved to take notes and even quot preserve quot them for quot later generations quot the very idea of writing an actual walkthrough for a game always seemed too daunting Recently however a friend suggested that I should be very good at writing a walkthrough so I decided to give it a try Thus this is my very first walkthrough If anything I might have gone quot overboard quot in spelling out all the details That's okay though since nothing would please me more than to be able to help outanyone no matter how adept at game playing they might be
Any words of encouragement ndash as well as comments questions and suggestions of course ndash would be most welcome Please direct all of these toZSZUBAIRIE AOL com Thank you
ABOUT THE GAME ITSELF I am sorry to say but this is reallynotthe best game I have ever played Indeed I wouldstrongly adviseplayers under the age of and people with good taste generally againstplaying this game In fact the quot good girl quot that I have always been I was truly embarrassed by all the depiction of nudity and offended by a lot of the language The fact that none of that was even quot necessary quot in this particular game made it all the more offensive
In all fairness however I have to say this if you cansomehowoverlook ignore and overallde sensitizeyourself to the nudity depictions of violence and offensive language you will find that the game has been designed rather cleverly involving interesting twists and turns My only recommendation to the designers and the developers would be to justclean it upa little actually quite a lot And I do so hope they will take this advice in earnest because therealgame behind all thisunnecessary clutteris really worth a good revision
Finally I would give two pieces of advice to those with the aforementioned good taste who might still like to try playing this game DON'T LOOK AT ANY OF THE PICTURES This means all the posters on the walls the magazines on the tables etc Unfortunately however there are twoEXCEPTIONSto this quot rule quot WARNING SPOILER COMING The first one is the card that youmustretrieve from a book in the Security Room See the section on that room in the walkthrough
You really can't avoid seeing the picture on that page but try because itisrather revolting Secondly youwouldhave to see the pictures on those nine cards butonlyon those nine cards to be able to answer Whip's riddle in the jail cell Again focus your attention on thequestionsitself andnoton the irrelevant pictures
AVOID PAYING TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE HERO'S REMARKS Don't try to turn off the volume of course because a lot of his comments are actuallycluesas to what you are looking for if you should either use a different icon orrepeatthe use of the same one etc So I guess the real advice is just toignoreanything crude or callous that he or some other character might say
THE WALKTHROUGH Generally This is a point and click game There are four icons for navigating through the game as shown below
The EYE icon CLOSE UP LOOK EXAMINE Be sure to keep this icon highlighted wherever you go It will quot alert quot you to all the possible points Also it is often onlyafterthe hero quot sees quot something and makes a comment will you then be allowed to pick up or interact with a critical object
The MOUTH icon CONVERSATION This is actually critical in only one place in the entire game to be noted later although you can often click on this icon to hear the hero make some wise crack at many spots
The HAND icon PICK UP RETRIEVE objects for example from a person safe etc
The POINTING FINGER icon USE ACTIVATE COMBINE This can be used either to make somechangein an item in the inventory combinetwo items in the inventory as well as tointeractwith something in the environment for example opening a door

As you step out of the elevator turn to the hero'sright the green directional arrow will be pointing up You will see two doors Use the loaded gun to shoot open the lock of the very first door to yourleft Enter the office Move forward and use the Action icon on the top pane to drop the window on the body's head Nasty I know but necessary to proceed in the game
Now step out of the office and back to the front of the elevator again

The Police Station As soon as the hero steps out of the hospital three officers approach him It doesn't really matter what answer you pick in response to their question until you finally click quot What business is it of yours quot The hero will then be asked for his ID Again there is only one quot magic quot answer quot I'm Katzman quot The picture on the ID card does not match the hero's face of course so he is searched and the police recover suspicious items microscope axe gun etc
The hero is then arrested and carted off to jail
The Jail There are two men playing cards on the table while a third one is sprawled out on the top cot to the right Use the Mouth icon to speak to the two men The big guy is called Hog the skinny one Grinya and the one lying on the cot is Whip Grinya will then tell you to pick a cot for yourself Turn around and Close up on the razor above the wash basin sink Use the Action icon on it to find that it has no blade The hero will automatically turn around then and ask the two men on the table for a blade They will tell him to speak to the guard and you will be brought back to your close up of the razor Step out of this close up and use the Action icon to knock at the door and speak to the guard He will refuse to give you a razor complaining about how the men had lost the last one he had given them Turn back towards the two men again and use the green directional arrow pointing up to move in closer to the cots Use the Action icon on the three empty cots one by one each time to be told by Hog that it washiscot Note There might be a bug in the game here but just try to get Hog to say thisthree times in a row once for each cot without letting Grinya interrupt or even Hog say anything else
Step back again and ask Hog which cot was yours then He will answer curtly and return to his game Address him again saying quot It's unfair quot Again he will answer and turn away Speak to him yet again saying quot All the cots are yours quot This will start a fight The hero will punch out Hog but Grinya will pull out a knife Whip will intervene then and the conversation will continue between him and the hero
You will have to ask all the questions that appear on the screen but this is good because it will help explain some things both about the story plot as well as the situation in town In the end you will ask about what should be done Whip will then tell you about a plan to break out but one of the men would have to serve as bait He suggests quot casting lots quot but not including himself in the game The game is as follows everyone would have to find at least three of the cards that Whip has hidden and then give the correct answer to the riddle on each one Hog and Grinya have already found three cards each but have not answered the riddles yet Now the hero has to beat them to it in order to avoid becoming the bait himself

The last three steps were necessary to enable you to use the cellular phone you are carrying because apparently in addition to the battery being discharged its service had been disconnected as well Step out of the close up of the computer You are done in this room now so head for the Special Door in the Pool room next
Beyond the Special Door The door is unlocked so just use the Action icon to go through As you enter you will find Whip on the floor next to the door Ignore him for now and move toyourleft to go through the door on the opposite side You will come out next to some kind of a holding cell There are two dead bodies behind the bars and a leather bag is lying between them Use the cue stick to drag the bag closer to the hero and then use theAction iconfive timesto rummage through its contents until you retrieve a partially used up cigarette of sorts The sixth attempt will indicate that the bag is empty now Enter the door to thehero'sright

Now enter the door to your left and you will find yourself in a large and luxurious office Up against the wall in front of you down on the floor you will see a very large black stereo or entertainment system
See theAction iconin the picture below Use theAction keyto retrieve a CD from the center of that system Move towards the desk to your left then Pick up a battery from a body in the chair behind this desk Now replace your phone battery by opening your inventory and picking up this battery and then using the Action icon on the phone to combine the two The phone is now working
Next come down to a shredding machine to your left and onyourside of the room Pick up the partly shredded piece of paper Now open the inventory look at this paper and make a note of the code written on it Kay You will see yet another body sprawled out on the floor to the right of the shredding machine Use theAction iconto get the hero to check the time on the wrist watch on this man'srightarm Make a note of that number

Use the Action icon to answer it You will hear some officer trying to negotiate but the hero will answer curtly and hang up You will have to use the Action iconfour more times however since the officer will keep calling back until the hero has answeredfive times in allbefore the ringing will finally stop Now step out of this close up go back around the partition rail and enter the door on your left
You will find yourself in a small hallway with only two doors on your left Use the key you had found earlier on thefirstdoor right next to the hero and enter the room Pick up a packet of powder from a stool against the wall in front of you At the bottom of your screen you will see a desk in the relatively dark part of the room On the upper left side of this desk there is an answering machine Use the Action icon on the machinefourtimes to hearallthe messages left by a single caller
You have everything you need to finally attend to Whip now so return to the corridor where he is still lying apparently unconscious Use the vial of liquid ammonia on him to bring him around He will talk for awhile but then start complaining of pain and ask for some quot downers quot Give him the Dimedrol pills He will then ask you for some quot grass quot Give him the cigarette He will then ask you to light it up so use the lighter to do so He will then ask you for some cocaine Give him the packet of powder you had just found After all this he will be able to talk at some length and die right after telling you to call someone nicknamed quot Stupor quot and apparently jotting down a phone number in your notebook The fifth Notebook icon will start flashing green of course so look it up and quot flip quot through the pages until it stops flashing Make a note of Stupor's phone number
Use the Action icon first on the phone to bring it out of your inventory and then again on the numbers to dial After clicking the numbers click theblue dashunder the mini screen on the phone See the Action icon in the picture below
The conversation will carry forward without your having to do anything at all Then as Stupor hangs up step out of the close up of the phone and return to the hallway with the two doors on your left Approach theseconddoor the one closest toyou this time Close up on the yellow sign on the door It says quot quot Lavatory out of order quot Use theAction iconto move the sign aside and expose a keypad behind Close up on this keypad and type onyourkeyboard the number from the dead man's wristwatch in the luxurious office The green light will flash as a clicking sound will indicate that the door has been unlocked You will then be brought out of this close up automatically but will still be in the one on the door Step out of this close up also and use the Action icon to enter the room
You will see a very large computer in front of you Close up on it

Step out of the close up of the computer
You will see that one of the large drawers to your right is now open Pick up a cartridge from it
Open the inventory now and use theAction icon first to bring out the phone and then to dial to call Stupor again Tell him that you found the cartridge He won't believe you and ask you to describe it Tell him that it isorange with a yellow stripe Stupor will then tell you that you would have to make your own way out but will also explain just how to do so Follow his instructions and go back out to the Cell Corridor and approach theleftdoor against the wall the one marked with a quot quot in the earlier diagram Use theAction iconon that door and the hero willautomaticallyknock the way Stupor had described The watchman will let you in and you will find yourself in a room with apparently no other door
Use the Mouth icon to speak to the man and the hero will tell him that he needs to use the underground passage You don't have to do anything yourself as the conversation carries forward with the watchman first asking for a pass and then agreeing to help if the hero would help him find the last word to complete a crossword puzzle Go to the small table on your left and close up on the one magazine lying at the lowerleftcorner of the table See the close up icon in the picture below
Close up on this magazine and see that it has the picture of a rather dangerous looking man on the cover Use theAction iconon this page to turn it to show the one with the crossword puzzle itself Now step out of the close ups use the Mouth icon to speak to the watchman again and tell him that you have guessed the word He will find it hard to believe Click on the fourth choice then NEBUCHADNEZZAR The watchman will indicate that it is the right answer Note If you looked carefully at the crossword yourself however you might have noticed that the number of empty spaces isless thanthe number of letters in the above word Moreover the letters in this word do not evencorrespondto the letters already filled in Nevertheless the watchman will accept it as the correct choice
You won't have to do anything yourself then as the watchman will then tell the hero to be on his way and the hero will start moving towards the other side of the room A cut scene will show the hero descending down a set of stairs and reappearing in some kind of an underground passage There will be only one directional arrow in this area appearing on a ladder in the center of the lighted passage in front of you Click on this arrow the hero will move towards the ladder and then the last cut scene will show the end of the story
About the Ending Spoiler The ending is rather vague but here is my particular take on it Apparently ourherois theultimatevillain i e the Black Lake Executioner There are many clues throughout the game to support this conclusion For one thing it explains the hero's frequent callous remarks It also explains why everybodybutthe hero seems to get killed off at both the hospital and the police station It even explains the hero's sensational quot confession quot at the interrogation that heisin fact the Executioner that everyone is looking for After all how can a man seeking toavoida dreaded punishment like the Deep Freeze even think about confessing to a series of crimes that would practicallyguaranteehis being placed in just that freeze unless he was in fact crazy enough to be the one committing all those crazy crimes in the first place
Again there is no doubt that the quot real quot Belov was quite cruel himself as indicated by his own henchman's remark at the end about their being afraid that he might have quot softened up quot in the amount of time he had spent in the freeze But then Belov turns to the hero and chastiseshimof being the cruel one indicating that the hero had even outdone him The most important clues to the hero's being the real Executioner however come from that quot flashback quot of course when the hero is knocked out by Belov's men Thus you hear someone shouting in the background about the fact that theExecutionerwas on the loose just as theherois speaking to the doctor telling him that the Feds were after him and that he needed the doctor's help to hide in the morgue etc Apparently the doctor had to give him some kind of a drug to make himlook quot dead enough quot to convince the Feds Remember the syringe on the desk in the morgue
Of course the doctor might well have even tried tokillhim with a drug knowingwhat a dangerous man he was Whether the doctor actually co operated or in fact tried to take advantage of the situation to kill and thus get rid of a dangerous man however the end result appears to be that the drug causes the hero to lose his memory even though it obviously helped him escape the police as well
Now one might wonder of course as towhowas doing the killing when the hero was unconscious in the morgue or in jail Very simply it must have been Belov's men Remember theirwhole purpose was to see to it and probably even help Belov's quot clone quot in securing and delivering to them the cartridge that would help quot thaw out quot Belov They might even have been trying to throw the suspicionoffthe hero to help him accomplish this task Indeed recall that that waspreciselywhy the officer didnot quot buy quot the hero's quot confession quot at the interrogation Thus the idea was to help the hero just long enough for him to deliver the cartridge and then Belov got rid of him himself because he was just way out of control attracting far too much attention from the police He didn't actuallykillthe hero however probably just in case he might need him again later So instead he just put him in the Deep Freeze

Notice the little triangle shape on the door
Take it to get your st puzzle piece
Walk back to the left and switch on the lamp on the table
Look at the odd shadow on the wall above the lamp
Take that strange shadow to get your nd puzzle piece
Look under the table and take the rd puzzle piece from under the table Look in between the cushions of the couch
Take the th puzzle piece from between the cushions
Look at the painting above the couch
Take your th puzzle piece from the collar of the shirt
Examine the left curtain of the right window to find the th puzzle piece
Do the same with the right curtain of the left window to find the th puzzle piece
Examine the shelf beneath the TV to find the th puzzle piece
Examine the water fountain to find the th puzzle piece
Well these are the easy puzzle pieces to be found
One more left to go
I must admit that the last one kept me off the streets for a couple of hours
To get a clue talk to the nurse who is sitting at the window sill
Ask her about the Big Quiet Guy
She answers you that he only opens his mouth when he eats
Now think hard to recall where you saw the one and only thing to eat
Yep that's correct is that chewing gum on the counter at the entrance of the sanitarium
Also remember that you took the clipboard from the wall that shouldn't leave the area
So head back to the entrance of the sanitarium and go inside
Give the clip board to the receptionist and off she goes to replace the clip board
After she has gone look at the counter and take the chewing gum
Now head back to the Big Quiet Guy
Give him the chewing Gum and voila the th puzzle piece
Enter Nordon's Cell
Now you only have to solve the puzzle on the floor in front of good old Norden
I must admit again that this one took me off the streets a couple of hours too
First of all have a good look at the 'Vinca' scrap and use the pieces of paper with the puzzle
The 'Vinca' scrap and the unsolved puzzle First notice that there are two symbols besides the upper two triangles and two symbols next to the bottom triangles
Than notice that there are similar symbols on the 'Vinca' scrap
Notice that the upper symbol on the 'Vinca' scrap exists of two combined symbols one exists of a straight line with a square at the end and the other one of a straight line with three strokes and with a square at the end
Notice that you see the symbol of the straight line with a square at the end at the bottom two triangles
Notice that the bottom right puzzle piece has the symbol of this straight line with three strokes and with a square at the end
So pick up that puzzle piece and place it on the left bottom triangle
Right click on it until the straight line with three strokes with the square at the end is facing the symbol with the straight line with the square at the end
Do the same with the second right puzzle piece from bottom
Now let's do the two upper triangles
Pick up the third left puzzle piece from bottom and put it on the upper left triangle
Right click on it until the two drops are facing the symbol next to the triangle
Pick up the bottom left puzzle piece and place it on the right upper triangle
Right click on it until the w shaped symbol is facing the symbol next to the triangle
Now have a look at the fifth combination from top of the two symbols on the 'Vinca' scrap
Notice that the upper symbol of them corresponds with the bottom symbol on the upper right solved triangle
Also notice that the bottom symbol of them corresponds with the bottom symbol on the fourth right puzzle piece form bottom
So pick up that puzzle piece and place it on the second right triangle from top
Click on it until two correct symbols are facing each other
Now have a look at the bottom combination of symbols on the 'Vinca' scrap
Notice that you see the upper symbol at the bottom of the right upper triangle
Pick up the upper right puzzle piece and place it on the second left triangle from top
Right click on it until the two combined symbols are facing each other
With these combinations of symbols on the 'Vinca' scrap place the other puzzle pieces and click on them until the two corresponding as shown on the 'Vinca' scrap are facing one and each other
That should result in the next solved puzzle
By the way with the 'Vinca' scrap in your pocket you can also cheat to solve this puzzle by clicking a few times on TOO HARD
But hey why should you with this given solution
The solved syzygy puzzle After you solved the puzzle you end up in front of the rowboat
Use the rowboat to go back

Because of the damn slogan on it she just has to allow you to use the computers
So have another look at the computer terminal
Push the enter button
In the Academic Journal Database Search type pleromic syzygy and press the search button
Read the article about Henrikson Lucius
On the last page read the article which is telling that a professor predicted an earlier pleromic syzygy
Note the name of this professor called Hosea Washburne
Close the document and press the back button
In the Periodical Database Search type the name of that professor Hosea Washburne and press the search button
Read the bottom article called 'Shall we all be destroyed '
that was published in the Innsmouth Sunday Post of April
Notice that Washburne claims in the article that the next Tuesday the th will mark the zenith of this alignment
Because the newspaper is of April this means that this alignment or better called syzygy would have taken place on April
Close the document and zoom out
Go back outside
Go to the Dome
Go inside and climb up the ladder at the left side of the room
You now are facing the planetarium
Notice that there are rings and you only have glass globes
Well we come to that later
First of all study Capwell's Notes once more
On page you can read that Capwell also mentions bolts
On page you read the order of the planets and that these cannot simply placed in order of distance
On page you see that the planets Jupiter Uranus and Yuggoth should be next to another
On page you read that the same goes for Mercury and Chthon
Also notice the very important note that to avoid obstruction Saturn must be on bolt
On that page you also learn that Uranus should be on a smaller lt bolt than Mars and that Neptune must be fastened to an even numbered bolt
Last but not least learn that Venus must be on a bigger gt bolt than Chthon and smaller lt than Jupiter
With this knowledge in mind and after some puzzling and very hard thinking you come to the conclusion that the only correct order of the globes must be Bolt MercuryBolt ChthonBolt VenusBolt NeptuneBolt SaturnBolt JupiterBolt UranusBolt YuggothBolt Mars So place all the globes to these bolts
That is except the Uranus globe because you don't have that one right
Wrong
In fact you are carrying the Uranus globe of some sort o Simply use the empty beer bottle as a replacement
So just stick the beer bottle on bolt
Be very very sure that you have them all lined up correctly
So make a final check that the Mercury is on bolt Chthon is on bolt Venus is on bolt Neptune is on bolt Saturn is on bolt Jupiter is on bolt the beer bottle is on bolt Yuggoth is on bolt and Mars in on bolt
When you are absolutely sure that you placed the globes correctly go back down
Look at the console at the right side of the astrolabe
Now remember the article you have read in the library about the alternative date of the syzygy of professor Hosea Washburne April
Punching in the date would be a little too easy of course
So keep in mind that you have to use the European date format
So set the upper left spinner to and the right one to
Set the bottom spinner to
Flip down the BC AC switch
Push the center button and nothing
Because of all the problems with finding the correct order of the globes and finding the correct date for the console you totally forgot that there is no power yet
First of all attach the wire to the cabling at the left side above the batteries
Look at the cabling
Zoom out and go back outside
Return to the crossroads
Go to the black smoke that is coming out of the woods once more
Talk to Steve
Ask him what he is looking at
Next tell him that you could use some energy
Return to the crossroads and go to the Dome
Look at the roof of the Dome
Notice the wolf tails that are hanging down from Steve
Zoom out and go behind the orrery
Remember the power outlet you saw before
Grab the wolf tails that are dangling down at the left side Well one thing is for sure the lightning rod or better said Steve worked fine o
Enter the orrery for the very last time
Look at the console
Push the center button to get a orrery sketch
Zoom out and go back outside
Use your map to go the lake
If you like you can also walk to the lake but using the map makes it all easier
To do this open your inventory and use the hand symbol on the map and click on the lake
Close the map
Standing by the lake go to the upper level to your right
Use your canvas rag with the water of the fountain
Use your map once more and go to the pentangle
Close the map and enter the building to the right
Look at the clock that is standing against the back wall
Study the orrery sketch in your inventory and make a note of the positions of the planets
The only one correct orrery sketch
Your goal of course is to set the dials of the clock into the corresponding positions
May be it is a good idea to save your game here just in case something goes wrong
Well here we go
Press the Mercury dial xPress the Uranus dial x Try to press the Earth dial
Great that one is stuck
Lucky that you brought the greasy rag along
So use the greasy rag with the Earth dial
Press the Earth dial xPress the Saturn dial xPress the Venus dial xPress the Neptune dial xPress the Mars dial xPress the Jupiter dial x If done correctly the sign at the bottom of the clock opens and reveals a package
No need to say that you have to take the package
The dials set correctly Get the package and end of Part
I hardly can't wait for part

Missing The thVictim by Paul Allan Note In order to play this game you definitely should have played the first edition quot Missing Since January quot as many references like websites are revisited here
Also be aware that this is practically a spoiler walkthrough starting withsite references but evt
giving solutions
If you get stuck in one part of the day then just go on with another ldquo hour of the day rdquo
Mails will come in from time to time to give you the necessary clues
I did not play the game according to the ldquo hour sequence rdquo but found out later that this should be the best technique and be aware that the right order is not necessarily the alphabetic order Start puzzle Find this website http www doomdiva com quabalah by entering some of the words from the circles it will allow you to finish this part
IANOR You can move the letters to the circles by quot chasing quot them in the right direction
At some point quot Helmstedt quot is shown while sounding a different noise
Search for this information and one of the sites returned is http www positiveatheism org hist bruno htm
You'll learn that this person is a good friend of Giordano Bruno
Find this website http www bruno giordano net magic html upon entering the phrase quot Articuli adversus mathematicos quot

NASNIA Click within the video picture at the spot where the sound changes cracks both horizontally vertically
If done correctly the video stops and shows her shoulder with an tattoo on it
Find this website http www demagia net bruno htm upon entering the words quot giordano bruno astral magic quot
Find the appropriate image and enter its name recall the 'heroic' reference
gt gt gt You now need to find the guardian angel of Carolina Find this website http www benatky webzine info upon entering the words quot Carolina Benatky Minerva Athena quot info which you get from a mail a bit later
Search for Carolina and you'll find her full name on this page quot drama Benatky nad Jizerou quot
In a later mail you find out that quot Athena quot could also have been entered for image name
Find this website http www lanterna magica net fr guestbook html by searching for the words quot Carolina Molikova quot
On one of the pages guestbook you'll find here name again and a reference to another website
You'll also find her email here lt caro post cz gt
Notice the numbers they appear to be representing her day month birthday she should have been born in according to the webmaster's commentary
Find this website http www geocities com shareebee angel html by searching for the words quot guardian angel born zodiac quot for an overview of guardian angels by day date
I found several similar sites with different spelling for the same angel
Find this website http www czech genealogicka org from above site
In the forum section you'll find a comment from Carolina referring to her guardian angel as login
Go there and fill in carolina jabamiah all lowercase to find her family tree and notice she was born in
Note I found the same angel but spelled as quot gabamiah quot and you can't login with this name
Note Birthstones site http www jewelryappraisal com birthstone almanac htm Chrysolite a tip given at after a certain period can refer to several orientations it seems that in this case that would be the hour according to this website http www harlequinbeads com cgibin beads library article html article LIB
YAYN Each sound click will give you a letter click st letter clicks nd letter etc
Eventually you'll be able to find the letters
After some time you'll receive a mail stating that quot Falkirk quot might be a French metal band or Scottich town
Find this site http falkirk free fr index site htm since Tom is Frenchman
Then check out the Pictures section and select the page containing the quot Magnus Imperium quot era
In the credits you'll find Tom's last name
Search for quot Tom Altman cameraman quot which gives you this site http www agence tomaltman com qui html
Find out who they are and you should find Tom's own website http www tomalt net and his Press card info
SADEDALI Start by clicking all eyes and one will remain open and give some keyword hints
Search for quot durer melancholia quot which gives you this site http www mathpuzzle com masquare htm and the solution for this part of the puzzle
Try to scan the red barcodes and maybe the orange as well in order to get a row of numbers and a new name to be found
A mail later reminds you that the numbers of the magic square have changed became
The numbers correspond to the alphabet but since the magic square numbers got increased by you need to do the same thing with the alphabet
easiest is to decrease the numbers by and they'll correspond now with the alphabet
Note A video is shown and in here the street name is mentioned where Hilde Gardener is murdered you need this name in SALLA so pay attention
It sounds like quot Stein quot something later you rsquo ll find out that they are actually walking down the street which starts at the corner of the Sweetheart Boutique SALLA A video is shown and remark that Hilde was burned here in a cellar found some references on it while looking around zwischenhausen Garfenlaube Boutique Sweetheart Stein immobilien and directions to Schloss castle Altstadt old ancient part of town
Searching for any of these words in Marburg did not give anything immediately
So went on with other puzzles and found reference in Sadedali
But read note below No immediate idea what to do look for untill a mail arrives telling to search for the street in Marburg where the murder took place
Still difficult to find a good map of Marburg I did find one here http www marburg de en
You need to know that the church is close to the railway station Haupt bahnhof at the corner of quot Deutsch hausstrasse quot a fact that I found on another map but with no street details
Just across the Amerika Haus you'll notice a street stating quot Steinw quot in German Steinweg Dutch steenweg French chauss e
Fyi stein steen stone can also have the meaning of castle hence the reference to schloss
If you search for quot Gardener Steinweg quot you'll come across this crippled site http www kunstklub uni marburg info
On one of the working News pages you'll find more info about the murder case and Hilde's full name
Search for her full name and you'll find her personal website http www hildeseite webde net
It now seems to me that this site is an important start site for further and passed search work The next puzzle ask you to find day of birth and place of Hilde her day of death nd birth of Tellus was as shown on the screen
You'll find this info at her personal site
Overwrite the date fields and fill in the birthplace in the last field
Note I was sure that there had to be some hint in the photo video
So instead of going for string searching I looked up the addresses in the German Yellow Pages http www gelbeseiten de yp quick yp
gt Stein Immobilien Ketzerbach street no cigar but close gt Boutique Sweetheart no result then searched just on Sweetheart and bingo Steinweg
The map is also of better quality and gives exact street location orientation streets crossing
gt Garfenlaube nothing but it gave me a choice to search for Gartenlaube Steinweg THAMUR You need to drag zodiac symbols to the middle see small squares above
A mail later tells you what to do in essence find the zodiac symbols related to fire
A list of names appear
Before searching for any of them start dragging the names to the fire
In doing so about of them remain
Try any of them will not work
Search for quot markus ackerman quot and this site will be returned http www ukde org index htm notice the other names in the search text
You'll find another Markus on this site and his last name solves the puzzle
NERON Just click on the crosses and some letters will give a ascending sound
You can then quickly find the letters you need
A remark tells you to look closely to the picture and you need to order the symbols according to the Seven Skies
Going around the picture shows the number quot quot somewhere
Now go and search for quot Leyde quot and this site is returned http www chimie medievale com fr index htm
On one of the pages you'll find the seven symbols just follow their order leave the empty circles for last or do them first
Btw this references to Johannes Trithemius found in a mail sent early in the beginning of the game The sequence used by Trithemius is Saturn Venus Jupiter Mercury Mars Moon Sun
OURER Keywords given Tycho Brahe Palace You need to restore the painting right upper corner remains empty
You now are asked for a name and a palace
is shown
I had seen this picture before a palace he had bought and restored as an observatory
So evt I went searching for quot tycho brahe astronomy quot which returned http en wikipedia org wiki Tycho Brahe
You'll find the exact picture and name of the palace
Keywords given Lover of Mars ancient empire city
A mail later tells us that Venus is that lover
I started searching for quot venus ancient egypt quot and came across this site http interoz com egypt gods htm
Looking for Venus in that page I stumbled across quot Phoenix quot as well
Searching for quot venus ancient egypt Phoenix quot returned this site http www egyptianmyths net phoenix htm which gives us immediately the name of the city
I missed its name already on the first site btw Note some more mails followed confirming the lead to this information
TANIE Bring bounce the little circle to the middle of the picture then make it bounce horizontally against the left bar
In my case it immediately showed message written down on the notebook
but you can obviously check it via the video as well
I saw these signs before in Missing I and found them back here http www demagia net corne html
This page allows you to translate the message
The th will take you to him
Logion refers to the Gospel of Thomas but searching did not give anything useful yet neither did logion
A next mail tells us that logion might indicate that we need to find the person that discovered Carolina in Benatky
The th and th video speaks about the Prague policeman Jamek but name could be wrong tried it
A mail later confirms the name incl spelling but it's not the solution
So he was the policman running the investigation
I searched for quot Jamek Benatky quot which leads us to this site http www radiozakaz cz net
Checking the pages didn't immediately help
A mail later tells us that we need to check the archives under the Tag button
quot ZAKAZ ARCHIV quot contains the name Jamek but I can't read anything of that stuff Tjech
It appears that the name shown at the end of the article Scaron t p n Bro x E k is our man
Filling in his last name without the accents ends this puzzle
Spoiler I have to admit giving up here stuck at this radio site and searched the internet for the solution maybe mails coming in later would have helped me evt
ABAI You see symbols Hebrew as you quickly can find out here http www demagia net corne html
Keywords Holy blood will reveal
Dropping blood in the center evt
shows that of them causes them to go up in smoke confirmed by a mail later on
So I figured I need a word made up of letters
These site produce clear Hebrew tables http www jewelmarketplace com hebraic and http www answers com topic enochian
Another mail follows telling us to look for quot gematria of the word Unity quot
Searching for quot gematria unity quot gives this site http www jewishpath org gematriajewishunity html
quot Echad Dalet Chess Aleph quot
Does this mean 'the number of drops '
Doing so causes the middle circle to turn 'bloodish' and dragging the small paper above it makes our name appear
A bouncing dot and swirling letters
Moving our mouse over the dot reveals a text starting with quot Ali Samman quot
Searching for quot ali samman quot reveals this site http www nag hammadi com history html
Upon reading the history I discover that the text appears to be several names of people who got in contact with the Nag Hammadi
In particular the th codex history is referenced on this page giving you all the names in one nice overview
I now understand where Thomas Malko fits in this whole picture see NATHALON below Note maybe I should have finished the puzzles following this order http www anges demons net us index htm
a bit late for that hum NATHALON Keyword Saturnia and a cross raster
Connect the crosses to form Saturnus
Check this site for a constellation lead http www demagia net bruno htm
Saturnus is pretty easy to follow understand
Juppiter is far less logical but you'll notice quickly that it becomes symmetrical around a vertical axis
Anton is the missing link
Several mails follow indicating a link of Carolina with Nag Hammadi the th codex
Searching numerous combinations did not get me anywhere
The best result quot anton molikova carolina quot gives links of which we came across earlier www czech genealogicka org index htm and www lanterna magica net guestbook html
I logged into Carolina's tree see earlier for login info and tried quot Havel quot as word no result
I stopped here and went on trying other sites combinations without result
Spoiler evt
I searched for the solution on the internet and found out that the solution was indeed to be found here www czech genealogicka org index htm I just needed to click a bit more to find another Anton
Later upon finishing ABAI I figured I should have finished that one first LAYON Numbers are shown next to some strange characters look like Greek and seen them before
Using the razorblade you'll evt
find Greek names on the left of the number column
I checked up on this site again http www demagia net corne html and bingo
And found the lowercase characters here http www mathacademy com pr prime articles greek index asp
be aware always convert the lowercase letters to its CAP letters
A mail later makes the connection with Jesus Christ
Keywords th sky demons Mardy French for Tuesday
Western side demon th hour of the day
I need to find names characters
I can pull at the small yellow ball and swing it in a particular direction Searching for quot Johannes Trithemius demon quot site a hint given in one of the mails came up with this site http www anges demons net us index htm
You find a lot of tabels and angels so I first went for anything 'western' and 'tuesday'
That quickly gave me the right table for the first names quot of Angels of the Fifth Heaven quot I got this confirmed by the puzzle itself since it moves automatically to the next character when you're correct
I could not find any other name matching the last demon so with trial amp error I completed this puzzle
Based on this new information finding the last of the demons I searched the internet for the demons and ended up here http www info us index htm
More mails follow and confirm this particular website
And more mails follow up on the history and try to explain Carolina's death
Does it all end here
Another site mentioned in a video was this one http www jimleroy net gb index html but I retrieved no valuable info from this site
Important note about the game Once a puzzle is finished you can not redo it for certain clues it would be helpfull to restart it
And I can't get rid of the feeling that my search did not always turn up the sites explicitly created for this game Or less time has been spent on this part of the game Another note there are some pretty good walkthroughs for this game in French
Use quot solution quot same meaning as in English to find them I do not plan to update this document but feel free to distribute it as long as you do not make any money out of it
No problem if you want to update this document with more precise info but please keep my reference being lt Paul Al gt

Morpheus A WalkthroughByDan KennedyDecember Introduction At first glance Morpheus appears to be a pretty standard adventure game cast in the Myst mould
The perspective is first person and the main gameplay takes place on a deserted ship and within several empty dream worlds
There is no inventory system and your only interactions are with ghosts as in The th Guest
The graphics are certainly nothing to write home about and the puzzles rarely get above the mildly challenging level
What sets Morpheus apart from other games in the genre is a well developed and thought out plot that will likely keep you thinking about the game long after you've finished it
The adult themes that are present in Morpheus such as controversial science experimentation child abuse and physical deformity are handled with a subtlety and thoughtfulness that is rarely found in a computer game
Into the Great White Open The game begins with an extended movie setting the scene our protagonist Matthew Holmes MH has journeyed to the arctic in to solve the mystery of his father's disappearance some years before
MH has gotten himself lost in a blizzard and is hiding down a crevice waiting to die
As he fades into unconsciousness he begins to dream about a boy named Jan who appears to have been mistreated by a number of people a boxer his mother a teacher and another boy
As the movie ends MH sees a vision of an ice bound ship and suddenly finds himself standing on the deck of the vessel
The aft deck of the ship gives you an opportunity to get familiar with the game interface
The stand by cursor is a ship's wheel press and hold the left mouse button down and move the mouse left or right for panning in all directions
An arrow cursor will let you know when movement is possible in any given direction and a magnifying glass allows closer inspection of an item
A yellow microphone indicates that MH has a comment about the indicated item or direction and a human hand cursor indicates that an object can be manipulated in some way
Have a look around you should be able to see a doorway leading into the bulkhead to your right but it appears to be inaccessible
Proceed forward and to the left and approach the life preserver hanging on the wall of the ship
Examine this item MH indicates that the name of the ship quot Herculania quot is the same one his father went looking for prior to his disappearance
Talk about being in the right place at the right time
Backing away from an object is accomplished by clicking the quot backup quot arrow
After the life preserver pan off to the left and proceed down the left side of the ship
This part of the deck ends with a set of doors
Examine the doors and press one of the black buttons unfortunately the doors are sealed
Before you go back to the aft deck have a look at the bird's nest to the left of the doors
Cross over to the other side of the ship and confirm that the doors here are also sealed
Examine the emergency station to the right of the doors
We're freezing this must be an emergency
Click on the hammer to smash the glass and press the red button
A distress balloon is released from the station unfortunately it gets caught up in the mast of the ship
If we can get it down we can at least examine the distress canister
Flaring Up Proceed back to the aft deck
Once you round the corner a ghostly figure appears over the metal cargo doors in the centre of the deck this unhappy man appears to be hanging himself
Once the vision dissipates go over to the cargo doors and look around
This may be a way into the ship but the doors are shut tight
Your next move should be to the accessible stairs to the lying bridge at the back of the ship
Standing at the top you see two pieces of equipment to the left and right
Click on the left equipment for a close up
To the left we see a flare gun mounted on an adjustable base to the right an adjustable viewing screen
A large pull down lever is located between the two machines
The position of the view screen can be changed by clicking and dragging the horizontal and vertical wires across the face of the viewer
The relative position of the wires can be determined by the position of the red lights along the base and the right side of the screen
If the vertical wire is placed so that the base level red light is in the th position from the left and the horizontal wire is placed so that the right side red light is in the second position from the bottom the distress balloon hung up on the mast should come into focus
To position the flare gun just match up the red lights on the gun mount to those of the view screen base level red light th from left right side red light nd from bottom
Move the gun by clicking and dragging it into position
Now pull down on the lever located between the flare gun and view screen
The rocket will take out the balloon and the distress canister falls to the deck by the right side sealed doors
Now take a step back from this equipment and examine the machinery to the right
The switch in the middle opens and closes the metal bay doors below
Pull on this switch the cargo doors try to open but are somehow blocked
Descend back down the staircase and go down the right side of the ship to open the distress canister
Clicking on it will play a message dated from the ship's captain JC Pharris
According to Pharris the ship is trapped in the ice at N latitude and W longitude
He indicates that something called the quot Neurographicon quot is still receiving power and that the interior of the ship has been sealed
Unsealing the Freshness Proceed back to the metal cargo doors where the ghost appeared
Try stepping out onto the doors themselves
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
Scary dead guy
You come face to face with the frozen corpse of the ghost
Step away to look at the body
He's left a suicide note
Examine the note apparently John Malherbe had no other alternative to offing himself
He mentions several names including Jan remember the boy from the opening dream sequence
and Claire and something about condemning people to dreams in the Neurographicon
Try scaling up the doorway to the deck too steep
Examining the cargo bays in the other three directions also reveals nothing
Have a look at the control panel next to Malherbe's body the panel controls the elevated platform that you are standing on
Pull down on the right lever to lower the platform to the next level
This lower lever also contains cargo doors in three directions and a smaller door in the fourth
Approach the smaller door and click on the wheel to open it
Inside you get a view of the inside of the ship's quot engine quot it also appears that you may have broken the seal into the ship those doors up on the deck may open now
Go back to the elevated platform and examine the cargo bay to the left of the doorway
Click on the crate with the green glow from within
Looks like something on the ship requires radioactive fuel
Return to the platform and pull on the right lever to descend to the bottom level
The bottom level of the hold has three cargo bays and a set of crates piled in front of the fourth
The contents of the crates are rather exotic flowers from Indonesia
One of the three cargo bays has a doorway on its right side
Click on the wheel to open the door and travel up the passageway back up to the deck remember that bulkhead doorway that was inaccessible
Lighten Up As you explore the ship further you will see a number of ghostly visions of the passengers
These visions help to flesh out the personalities and motivations of the characters and occasionally help to reveal clues or move the story along
Since the visions are too numerous to mention I will only discuss them if critical to the game's advancement
Make your way along the right side of the ship to the previously sealed doors and enter the ship's interior
Apart from a few silhouettes of tables and decorations there's not much to see in this room with the lights off
Make your way forward to another set of doors and go back out onto the ship's deck
Enter the door on your left
You will see a hooded ghost moving off to the left ahead of you
Take one step forward turn to your left and descend a staircase
You will see the faint outline of a door in front of you
Turn around and approach the circular object with a silver knob on top
Touch the knob this turns out to be a solar powered switch for opening a huge skylight
Click on the switch after the skylight opens for an explanation of the light source
Now that we've got some light but no power yet let's do some looking around
Facing the staircase move off to the right and forward several steps until you enter a small theatre
Turn to your right until a small projector comes into view
Press the top button to start the film how is this projector powered
and watch a newsreel about Matthew's father and his attempt to cross the arctic in a balloon
Once the film is done turn around and exit the theatre but first examine both sides of a postcard lying on the steps
The card was written by quot Claire quot to her uncle and speaks of Jan the disfigured inventor of the Neurographicon hereafter referred to as NG 'cause I'm lazy
Step forward and note the four ornate film viewers located to the left and right of your position
Starting on your right approach the first viewer and grab pull down one of the two handles on either side of the eye pieces
The first film introduces the six passengers of the Herculania the boxer Leo Galte Jan's natural father the dancer Belle Swan Jan's natural mother Belle's wheelchair bound step daughter Claire Jan's childhood friend Billy Mexler Grace Thermon Jan's guardian at the Goodman Home for Boys and Dr John Malherbe a Herbalist and Jan's personal physician
Keep turning to the right and begin the film within the second viewer
The quot unseen power source quot from quot beyond death quot of the NG is discussed as well as its potential use as a regenerative tool thus Claire's presence on the ship
Continue turning to the right past the entrance to the theatre and begin the film in the third viewer
Details of the luxurious Herculania are given including the personalization of the ship to its passengers
The film also discusses the relationship between the rich ship builder JC Pharris and his adopted son Jan
Begin the fourth film this gives a quick look at John Malherbe's research into the power of Indonesian flowers
The film mentions that the locals use a serum comprised of blood the Black Orchid the rare Valley Orchid and a fourth ingredient to tap the mysterious power beyond life
Once the films are done step forward towards the strange blue doorway across from the theatre
On closer inspection the door is inaccessible with a humming atomic symbol on its surface
Back away and turn to the left and right
The staterooms of JC Pharris and Jan are located here
We have no idea how to access these rooms yet so proceed past the blue doorway and return to the bottom of the staircase
The doorway at the bottom of the stirs leads to a short hallway containing doors to the staterooms of the six other passengers as well as a large model of the ship
The door on the other side of the hallway like the blue one we just examined is currently inaccessible
Pokin' Around Return to the stairway and go up the stairs
Turn to your left up more stairs and turn left again
Now proceed along the upper hallway to the large doors at the far end of the room have a look at Belle's poster and enter
This ballroom is the large dark room that we entered previously
Turn to your left go up the stairs and click on the closest viewer to see Grace Thermon sneak a peak at someone
Go back down the stairs up the other staircase and look into the closest viewer to see the guests dancing during a costume ball gee what a crowd
Back on the ground floor go to the right towards a set of doors on the far wall and pass what looks to be Claire's wheelchair on your way across the room
Proceed through the doors into the garden
How did these plants survive
Wander around the displays and see if you can find the exotic orchids from Malherbe's film black and valley
Note the amphibian tank at the far end of the garden and click on the net if you can find it
It appears that Malherbe had a strange interest in frogs
Access the shed found along the same wall as the doors leading to the ballroom inside you'll find the pumping system that's kept the plants alive and a map of the garden with some chart showing some curiously descriptive words on it
We'll need this later
Proceed back to the ballroom through the doors we came originally came in and go towards the right of the stairwell there should be a doorway straight ahead
Proceed through and look around the Y shaped hallway decorated with boxing posters
Leo Galte's poster seems to be missing
Turn around and note the presence of another strange blue inaccessible door could this be an elevator
Proceed left past the elevator through the door turn to your left and go back onto the ship's deck
Keep moving along the right side of the ship you will eventually encounter a bench with what looks like a piece of paper on it
Click on the paper ton watch Grace Thermon get a nasty surprise
Proceed straight ahead until this level of the deck ends
Turn to your left and enter the door in front of you
You are now on the ship's bridge
Standing in the centre of the bridge and looking forward there are five pieced of equipment that can be examined
Starting from the left the first is a still rotating radar screen
The second is the engine control levers ominously set at Full Dead Stop
The third is the ship's wheel with a quick shot of JC at the helm
The fourth piece of equipment looks to be some sort of radio squawking at us
The fifth piece of equipment is some sort of recorder
Click on it once to hear JC Pharris' audio ship logs
Successive log entries are played by clicking on the recorder once the prior log entry ends
The logs trace the instability of the NG's performance and Jan's apparent deepening madness
Interestingly it's the NG that is causing the ghostly apparitions that walk the ship
Eventually Jan takes control of the ship and traps the other passengers in the NG
With Malherbe dead JC has no choice but to wander off looking for the senior Holmes' balloon expedition
Head back out onto the ship's deck and return to the crab's bench
Now descend the staircase directly in front of the bench and make your way to the bow of the ship
Click on one of the lifeboat racks to note an interesting detail
Examine the large piece of equipment at the front of the ship it can be rotated but is useless without power
Its time to get this ship powered up
Proceed back along the left or right side of the ship and return to the large staircase in the ship's interior
Power to the People Descend the main staircase and turn around to the left
Proceed towards the theatre but before going past the blue door turn to your right and go through the doors along the right wall there is an identical doorway on the other side of the elevator
Descend the stairs and enter the bowels of the ship
Move towards the double doors located on the far wall and enter
You are standing in a small area overlooking the engine and its parts
Turn to your left and examine the quot Solar Voltaic Circuits quot
Is this thing on or off
Pull down on the lever to the left oops the lights went out
Pull on the lever again to turn on the lights
Move away and examine the quot AIV Sequencer quot equipment to the right
The A I and V refer to the Atrium Injectors and the Ventricle parts of the NG
We must obviously get this working as it appears to be without power
Press the button on the left and a gondola moves towards us and stops
Get in note that the controls for the gondola consist of levers and buttons on the left and right of the gondola
The levers move the gondola forward and backward while the buttons raise and lower installations from below
Try hitting the button on the right a ladder pokes up through the gondola's base
Proceed down the ladder and take a stroll around the bottom of the ship move to your left and make your away around the engine room
Just before arriving back at the ladder you will come across a piece of paper mounted on the wall beside some gauges and valves
Examine the paper it looks like a quot to do quot list for the engine crew
The list mentions that due to a guest's complaint the water heater temperature has been set to degrees the checkmark indicates that this task was completed
Another item mentions that the fountain is not displaying the correct ratios for the heaters this must have been fixed as well
The third item yet to be completed mentions that the rocket launcher can be aimed at the mast lucky for us as we found out earlier
Proceed back to the ladder and climb back in the gondola
Lower the ladder away by pressing the left button
Now to power this puppy
Grab the handle on the very right side of the gondola and pull it to advance the gondola ahead one position you can track the relative position of the gondola using the lights displayed over the quot Injectors quot label
Hit the button on the right to raise a lever mounted on a post
Grab the lever and pull to the left until a blue light appears above the quot Atrium quot label and then press the button on the left to lower the post
Pull the right lever to advance to the next position and hit the right button to raise a series of red thingamajigs
Press on one of the red things to activate the light above the quot Injectors quot label and press the left button to lower the mount
Now pull the right lever instead of advancing the gondola one position the gondola spins around degrees
So how do we get to the next position
Just pull the left lever this causes the gondola to move backward one position getting us to the last installation since we turned around backwards the only way to move forward is to go backwards hellip well take my word for it
Hit the right button to raise up another lever mounted on a post
Grab the lever and pull to the left until a blue light comes on above the quot Ventricle quot label and lower the post using the left button
Now we want to get back to our starting point
Pull on the right lever to move back one position and again to turn the gondola around
Now pull the left lever twice to move the gondola back to your starting place
Have another look at the AIV Sequencer now the A I and V symbols are all lit up a red colour
Grab the lever on the right side of the panel and pull down
Congratulations you've powered up the NG
Watch the vision of JC and Jan fighting over whether to continue with the experiments
Belly Up to the Bar With the power on we are free to more fully explore the ship
In particular we'll be looking out for the digit combinations to the staterooms of the six guests
Proceed back out the doors and go up to the theatre level using the stairs to the left or right
Go over to the elevator and click on the doors to enter
We have a choice of four floors to visit
Its time to head to the bar hit floor No
Once the elevator stops you are ushered out into the ship's lounge
Turn to your right and click on the bar for a close up of a cigar and Billy enjoying some of life's pleasures
Keep panning to your right and click on the card on one of the bar tables
Apparently Belle Swan will be accompanied by a flute drums and oboe during her Salome performance
Continue to pan right and follow the arrow to the right of the elevator
There will be a booth behind you click on the cards on the table's surface to watch Billy pulling a fast one on Leo
Return to the centre of the room and click on the coloured panels across from the bar
Leo dances like he's punch drunk or just drunk
Proceed through the doors located directly across from the elevator
You are taken though a hallway directly into the ship's dining room
Turn to your left and click on the table with the cigar collection to watch Grace giving Billy the business for smoking
After the ghosts clear off click on each of the compartments of the cigar case to get a close up of the cigars in each one
After viewing the cigar from the top central compartment the cigars shift over to reveal a card
Pick up the business card and examine both sides it appears that Billy has entered the highly respected profession of fountain sales
Proceed through the room and exit by the far doorway
Another hallway whisks you to another door open it by pressing one of the buttons and you're on the ship's bridge again
Turn around and make your way back to the elevator
Press the button for Level
The elevator opens up into the hallway decorated with the boxing posters
Approach the spot where Leo's poster used to be mounted and click on the blank space to see a confrontation between Belle and Leo
Click on the small plaque as well to see Leo's weight class Welter Weight
Since the poster is gone we don't know Leo's weight unlike the other boxers pictured in the hallway
Proceed through the doorway into a gymnasium
The Boxer and the Dancer Go directly to the swimming pool straight ahead and click on it to hear a ribald conversation between Leo and Grace sounds like Leo still appreciates his ex flame Belle
Pan toward the right and move towards the free weights and rowing machines
Click on a rowing machine to take it for a spin and then examine the barbells
Two appear to be missing the two pound barbells to be exact
Note the magnifying glass cursor above the missing weights click here to see Leo weighing himself
Pay close attention to what he says
Leo first mentions that he is the exact same weight that he was when he knocked out Fightin' Ned Flanders in the rd
He then picks up the barbells steps on the scales and promptly proclaims himself heavyweight champion of the world where's Don King when you need him
Once the movie is over proceed back to the doorway and click on the scale
The weight guidelines tell us that for a heavyweight you must be lbs or more
Leo's poster mount tells us that he fought as a welter weight according to the weight limits that puts his fighting weight between and lbs
Since Leo is holding lbs when he steps onto the scale again he must have weighed lbs during his fighting days as he does now
Put another way the only weight that lies within the welter weight range that Leo could have combined with the lb barbells to get to the heavyweight range which starts at lbs is lbs
Hmm lbs could this be Leo's stateroom code
Before you leave the gym be sure to look around the fighting ring and have a go at the old fashioned fat jiggler machine by the door
After exiting head right past the elevator and go through the doors into the main staircase room
You will get a first hand view of Leo's hatred for dogs
For a quick diversion turn to your right go out on deck and click on the snow beyond the ship's railing
Apparently Leo reached his limit with Belle's dog and made it walk the plank
Go back inside the way you came
Go over to the doorway into the ballroom and enter
Move off to the left and turn to your right to look at the room's music juke box
This is what was to supply the music for Belle's Seven Veils dance
Remember what instruments were to accompany her
We got this from the bar upstairs it was a harp a drum and an oboe
Click directly on the instrument labels to scroll through the instrument choices until Belle's musicians are set
Now we must tell them which song to play
There are vertical sliders located on either side of the label below the instruments showing the name of the song
Slide the slider up or down until the right music is selected Salome's Seven Veils of course
Hit the quot Play Selection quot button at the bottom of the machine and the music plays
Keep your clothes on and jot down the digit number displayed in the centre Belle's stateroom code
Before you leave the ballroom go over to Claire's wheelchair and click it to watch Jan's moment of triumph followed by one of great despair
For a few shining moments Claire can walk and Jan appears without his disfigurement
Next click on the green jester's hat on the floor to see the other passenger's reaction to the turn of events
Evidently everyone concerned has been quite hard on Jan particularly his father
The Swindler and the Prude Now that we've got the codes for Leo and Belle we must work on Grace and Billy
Make your way out of the ballroom down the stairs past the passenger staterooms and into the baths
Recognize Billy's fountain
Click on it to watch Billy's vision of the future and Grace's opinion of it
After the movie pick up Billy's next card he's also into toilet sales this seems to flow naturally from his other job
Turn to your left and enter the mud room
Right away we see Billy's next installation
Move over to the shower in the corner and check out the room's items
The mud bath doesn't look too inviting and the personalized cabinets are all locked
Click on the toilet to watch what seasickness or booze does to Billy and his introduction to the bidet
After he's done click on the key he's dropped in the basin and then click on his locker quot Mexler quot to open
Billy's got a peculiar poster in his locker and a most peculiar number scrawled on it
Billy either likes his ladies meaty or he's written his room code on the sheet or both I guess
Exit the mud room and go directly into the herbal lab
We've got some activity in here
Off to the right there's a large mechanical mixing machine stirring up a batch of mushy flowers
Over on the bench Malherbe's been dissecting frogs for some reason recall him desperately trying to catch one in his garden above
Over at the chair click to watch Malherbe preparing Grace to take some blood in order to make up a serum for her dream journeys within the NG
Turn to your left there is some sort of mixing machine here with peculiar labels along the sides
The labels should look familiar recall the chart in Malherbe's garden
The doctor must be making up some of his goofy Indonesian whack out drink with this equipment
This machine like the juke box in the ballroom seems to display a digit code in the centre
Hmm hellip Malherbe's stateroom code anyone
We'll need to go back up to the garden to get a little more information
Exit the herbal lab and walk around the fountain to access the three doors behind
The baths are equipped with a Frigidarium brrr a Tepidarium I don't know hellip well maybe and a Vaporarium now we're talking
Press on any of the doors to get a close up of a small plaque
Press the button to reveal a thermal lock
We must enter the correct temperature into all three thermal locks to open these doors
Now turn around and look at the fountain
According to that sheet posted in the basement the heaters have all been turned up to degrees and the fountain shows the correct ratios between the temperatures in each of the three rooms beyond
Hitting the blue button Frigidarium F will cause one spout to run hitting the purple button Tepidarium T will cause two spouts to run and hitting the orange button Vaporarium V will cause three spouts to run
So the temperature ratio F T V is
Since we know that one heater is set at degrees the temperatures will be as follows Frigidarium degrees Tepidarium degrees and Vaporarium degrees
Whoever said puzzles have to make any sense
Enter the corresponding temperature into each thermal lock use the dial to the right on each lock to open the three doors
Have a look inside the Tepidarium and the Frigidarium but there's nothing much to see
Enter the Vaporarium and look at the towel hanging to the right of the entry door Grace has been here
Click on the covered bench to see some classic Grace grouching
Now enter the inner room
Click on any of the wall spouts to fill the basins with hot water and the room with steam
Click on the door looks like Gracie wrote something on the window with her finger quot Psalms quot
Not only is this a relevant passage clean hands and a pure heart indeed
its also Grace's stateroom code
The Good Doctor Proceed out of the baths back up the stairs through the ballroom and into Malherbe's garden
Do you remember the three ingredients in his trance inducing serum besides blood
Well we had the Black Orchid the rare Valley Orchid and a mysterious third ingredient
At this point you should be able to take a shot at what this mysterious substance is think about his workbench his net in the garden and the amphibian tank
Yes frog guts
Walk around the garden and locate the positions of these three ingredients the Black Orchid is close to the Amphibian Tank and the Valley Orchid is close to one of the entry doors
One you've found all three proceed into the supply shed look at the diagram and come up with the three important sounding descriptors these should be Earth frogs Death Black Orchid and Soul Valley Orchid
Make your way out of the garden and across the ballroom to the staircase
Take this opportunity to go out on deck travel all the way to the very front of the ship and click on that funny looking piece of equipment at the bow
We get to see Jan ordering Malherbe to continue with the experiments against his father's wishes
We may be able to confirm our stateroom codes from the supposed list of them in Malherbe's room
The doctor looks less that comfortable with the entire situation
Proceed back along the deck inside at the stairs down past the staterooms and into the herbal lab
Click on the mixing machine to the left click on the three correct descriptors Soul Death and Earth and watch the machine spin around
The number is displayed on the machine once mixing has finished Malherbe's stateroom code
Go out of the herbal lab and leave the baths area
After entering the stateroom corridor turn to your left to face Malherbe's stateroom
Since we know where the doctor is or at least where his frozen corpse is we can start here
Press the left button on the door to open up the digit displays and click on each digit to scroll through until you've got quot quot displayed
Click on the right button to open the door
The only items of interest in here are located on the table to the left
Click on the wooden box with the leaf symbol to open it
The piece of paper shows that the Pod Extraction Code whatever that is is
None of the containers have serum in them it appears that the doctor did not prepare serum for himself
Now click on his notebook we only get a small portion of the stateroom code list but its enough to give us Claire's room code
Read through Malherbe's diary entries dating back years
From his notes it appears that Jan has had to undergo some long and painful treatments at the hands of a quack
Malherbe was obviously a weak man who worried for his future and the impact that the NG would have on his own research
It's time to have a peek inside one of the other passenger's staterooms
Exit Malherbe's room cross the hall and enter Billy Mexler's code into the lock on his door
After entering the room move forward and look about the room
Clicking on the bed gives us insight as to how Jan and Malherbe quot convinced quot Billy to take part in the experiments
Click on the bathroom door to get a glimpse of Billy's inner sanctum a vomit free toilet demonstration can be viewed by examining the toilet in here
The interesting stuff is on the desk located across from the bed
Start by examining the small printing press on the right side of the desk
Pull the right lever down to see how Billy became an instant expert in any profession of his choosing
Examining the desk drawer will reveal a set of rubber letters for the press and the garbage can to the right of the desk contains a number of misprinted cards
The piece of paper located on the left edge of the desk is a copy of Mexler's invitation to sail on the Herculania
Click on the box located next to the printing press to reveal the tools of the scam artist loaded dice a set of marked cards and a series of printed cards including a ruined Honus Wagner baseball card
The box also contains a locket with pictures of a heavyset woman and a pudgy boy a toy merry go round and a flyer for a circus dated
The items obviously indicated some connection between Billy and the circus
Now open up the other wooden box with the spade symbol on it
The box appears similar to Malherbe's serum receptacle except that one the serum bottles contains a liquid
Pick up the red coloured serum
Notice that the stationary cursor has changed from a ship's wheel into a small vial containing Billy's serum
This change will remain until we find a way to use the serum
But how do we do that
Well there is one floor accessible from the elevator that we have not visited yet
Proceed to the elevator and go to the Sanitorium on the fourth floor
Sanitorium or Sanitarium
This place should look familiar to you as you exit the elevator it's the room pictured on the front of Claire's postcard to her uncle found on the steps of the theatre
Step forward turn to your left and click on the mechanism to see a close up of Billy's customized NG equipment
Pressing on the button on the front of the equipment gives us a glimpse of a sleeping dead Billy a portion of our dream concerning Billy that we had prior to boarding the ship and a quick view of what appears to be a carnival at the end of the vision
Turn around and look at the equipment located across from Mexler it appears to be unused
Now look about the room you will see equipment set up for Belle Leo and Grace as well as another set of unused equipment in the back left corner
Belle's vision gives us a peak at a Persian palace while Leo and Graces' visions yield glimpses of a darkened street and a beach respectively
Proceed over to the contraption located to the right of the door as you walk in the room
Another digit code is necessary could this be the Pod Extraction Code we found in the rooms of Mexler and Malherbe
Grab and pull up down on each number wheel and set the digits to read
Pull the right lever down and watch the unused equipment to our left spring into life
A pod like structure is inserted into a hole in the floor
Watch the vision of JC and Malherbe dealing with the apparent deaths of the four passengers in the NG and note the secret doorway to the right of the pod extractor control
Once the vision is over turn around and face the newly inserted pod equipment the name label says MALHERBE
Did Jan intend to send his physician into the same dream hell as the other passengers
Go back to the corner where you saw the secret door and click forward to enter the bowels of the Neurographicon
Down below the five inserted pods are in the same arrangement as the equipment above
Examine the four occupied pods to get a look at the four guests are they alive or dead
Note the open pod located across from Mexler click on the pod to hear a compelling argument to get inside and use the serum
There's also something at the end of the row of pods
Walk up to the structure at the far end of the row and click on it to get a chilling vision of Jan he must be the NG Dream Master
Is he alive or dead
Walk back up the row of pods and peer ahead at the person located in the window is it Claire in that strange compartment
Don't bother clicking on her form this will just take you back up the stairs to the Sanitorium
Its time to enter the dream world of Billy Mexler perhaps learning his inner most secrets will help us understand the mystery of what occurred on the ship
After hearing the narration on the pod click to enter
After the door closes there are five symbols displayed
Billy's serum symbol was the Spade so click on it and be transformed into Billy's dreams
Billy the Freak You find yourself in the middle of a carnival hellip of the damned
Seriously though the place is operating but is totally deserted
Begin by examining the organ with the horse pictures on it located next to the central merry go round
There are six coloured knobs located above the keyboard that can be pulled out or pushed in to change the number above each knob
Press the keyboard to get a short set of notes but little else
Clearly we'll need to know more before we can solve the mystery of the organ
Turn around to face the fortune teller's wagon and click on it to see the teller herself
Not much you can do here there are three blank spots displayed below her maybe we need to bring her something
Step away and move in a counter clockwise direction around the merry go round
A large fun house is located left of the fortune teller proceed there enter the building and click on the screen to watch the show
The production consists of scenes the circus arriving in town the jester cruelly taunting the monster the disastrous fire the elephant running wild and the monster saving the jester
I sure do love a love story
Exit the fun house and continue to the left to a horseracing game
Click on the starting pistol in the top right corner to begin the race
The six horses race across the screen and the blue one wins Hit the pistol and watch the race again we get the same results
The colours should look familiar they are similar colours to the ones on the organ knobs
Record the order of finish Blue Red Lime Lilac Black and White
Now go back to the organ and position the six knobs to match their order of finish in the race i e
set Blue to White to etc
Now click the keyboard and enjoy the merry go round ride
Once you are done click to get off and receive a Queen of Hearts card
Place it on one of the empty places at the fortune teller's wagon
Proceed back around the merry go round past the horseracing game to the poster of King Colossus
Click on the garbage cans located behind the poster a big rat jumps out and scares us off
Now click on the Ferris wheel and enjoy the view from the top
Keep proceeding in a counter clockwise direction and click on the Oddities trailer to enter
Click on the closest display and read about the mermaid
Click to the left to see the beast itself and then examine the curtain below to see how they concocted this beast looks like a big fish and some plaster of Paris
Examine the next display and read about the world's smallest brain the same weight as a ounce coin
The cauliflower used to make the quot brain quot can be examined under the curtain below
The third display shows the severed hand of an electric man
His secret underneath the curtain he's plugged into the wall
Upon exiting the Oddities trailer a note flies into our hands
The flier details the substantial girth of King Colossus average men needed to lift him and his yearly tax of coins the same type of coin that is weighed against the brain in the Oddities trailer
Now examine the small arcade to the left of the trailer
This device requires us to guess the weight of the fat lady by entering a number using the three red levers slide the levers over to the right to change each digit above
The weight guess is submitted by pulling down the black lever in the top right corner
Since we don't know this weight we'll have to come back in a bit
Continue to circle the merry go round at the poster of the Bearded Lady stop and examine the garbage can
We are able to knock it over and the spilled popcorn has attracted out nasty rat friend
Perhaps we can now look into the other garbage cans by the King Colossus poster
Continue along past the closed trailer next show at and stop at the strong man's hammer game
Click on the hammer to grab it and hit the target I always knew you were a He man
Note the guideline to the right a Weakling can manage pounds of pressure
an average man can handle pounds and a He man can do pounds
Examine the poster of the fat lady to the left of the hammer game
The fat lady is exactly balanced with what looks like King Colossus and a bag of money
Can we use this information to calculate the fat lady's weight
The hammer game tells us that average man can handle pounds
The Colossus flier indicated that average men could carry the regent
Therefore the King must weigh men x pounds per man pounds The bag of money is presumably his yearly tax of coins
As we learned in the Oddities trailer coin weighs ounces
Therefore the bag of coins must weigh coins x ounces per coin x pound per ounces pounds If the king plus his money weighs pounds then the perfectly balanced fat lady must weigh the same
Go back to the arcade and using the three red levers input pounds into the guessing game as the weight of the fat lady
Pull the black lever and claim your Queen of Diamonds prize for the fortune teller
Its now time to re examine the garbage cans by the King Colossus poster
Click on them to travel through the fence to the trailer of the fat lady I'm guessing by the size of the underwear
Enter the trailer and click on the suitcase under the bed once you open it a poster advertising the lady and her pound month old son Will is displayed
Could this be Billy
Close up the suitcase and exit the trailer
Proceed off to the right of the trailer to the stage door for the fun house
Open the door and note the ropes off to the right
First turn down the house lights by pulling down on the switch under the ropes
Now pull down on each of the ropes to see a different scene from the play
The scenes must be played in order from start to finish and the house lights must be turned down each time you attempt to order the ropes
The correct order is far right rope circus comes to town middle rope jester cruelly taunts the monster far left rope disastrous fire nd rope from left elephant runs amok and nd rope from right monster saves jester
We are rewarded with the Queen of Spades
Placing the last card on the fortune teller's wagon causes us to transfer back to the Herculania just in time to see Billy's face melt away I guess his spirit is finally at peace
Amazing Grace Proceed back upstairs and using the elevator return to the passenger staterooms
Find Grace Thermon's stateroom and punch in her code of
Enter her room and have a peek around
Grace's doll collection can be viewed by examining the large suitcase to your left
Move forward into the room and click on Grace's bible located to the left of her bed
The bible contains a letter dismissing her from her position at the Goodman Home for Boys due to cruel punishment and something involving the police
Examine the hat box located to the right of the bed
Grace is one sick twisted puppy and has a thing for solitary confinement
Finally examine the wooden serum box with the flame design on it and pick up her serum container
Make your way back down to the NG and enter the empty pod
Press the serum into the flame shaped receptacle and hang on for the ride
You are transformed to a beautiful tropical beach with a giant waterfall and find yourself standing in front of a grass and mud hut
Click on the hut to go inside where there are three burning torched fashioned out of clay figurines
There's nothing to do here yet so exit the hut and travel up a short hill to the left towards some upright poles
At the top of the hill you will find yourself surrounded by drums mounted on a series of poles
As you pan across the poles you will hear each drum sound
Try spinning around a bit you'll notice that the drums will sound more consistently when you are travelling in a clockwise direction
Make the drums play by spinning around at a slow pace and then gradually build up speed if you start too fast the drums will stop playing
Soon you will be spinning wildly out of control and end up inside the hut with a flame in your hand
Click on one of the torches to extinguish the flame and disintegrate the clay figure
Back outside head in the opposite direction from the hill
Eventually you will come to a location with a cave entrance to one side and a path up the beach on the other
Proceed up the beach to a tall thin structure and a small graveyard
Examine the graveyard and click on the individual gravestones only children are buried here
Now turn around and enter the structure you will find yourself below ground with caves leading off in different directions in front of you
Enter the caves randomly until you encounter a screaming gorilla in one of them my wife actually still has nightmares about this gorilla after two years
A box with a monkey on top will appear before you turn the box around and read the inscription quot To my darling son who would have been
May the angels continue to watch over you quot
You are then transported back to the graveyard examine the gravestones to find the stone for the year old boy and place the box in the flower pot on the tombstone
The stone is the furthest one to the right and has the name Stephen Speer on it
If you somehow screw it up you'll have to head back underground and find the gorilla again
After succeeding you will be sent back to the hut to extinguish another torch
For the third torch go back outside and proceed into the cave you saw earlier
Move forward towards the large idols until you are standing in front of a large round stone
There will be three suspended chairs surrounding the stone
Click on the chair on the opposite side of the stone from you sit down and pull the hanging chain
The chair will rise and stop
Now pull the lever sticking out of the wall the stones groan and then stop
Pull the chain again to lower yourself to the ground
The round stone is now bathed in light
Proceed back to your initial vantage point and now choose the chair located immediately to your left sit down and elevate
Again pull the lever sticking out of the wall and descend again
Now the ball has been replaced with a flat mirror
We now must position the mirror in the correct direction From your original position select the chair on your right side ascend and pull the lever twice you will need to wait some time between the two pulls to allow the contraption to stop moving
Descend back to the ground the mirror should be directing light upward towards the chair located immediately to your left
Climb into the left chair and ascend to the top
Turn around you should have a route open to you across the rafters
Click ahead until you can see the giant waterfall through a crack
Go out through the crack and soar off into the sky for a breathtaking scene
Once you've landed you'll be back in the hut ready to extinguish the last flame
You will then be automatically sent back to the Herculania to watch Grace fade away finally free of her many demons
Leo the Lyin' Make your way back to the staterooms and use the code to enter Leo Galte's room
Click on Leo's bed to hear him rage against Billy and admit to some funny business long ago in Ireland
The only items of interest on Leo's table are his boxing poster and his serum box which is decorated with a rose symbol
Open the box grab the serum and proceed back down to the empty NG pod
Click on the rose symbol to be transported to Ireland
You find yourself standing in front of a flower cart run by someone named Molly
However the flowers are all dead inside the cart
Turn to your right and head towards the police station located ahead
Before going in the front door have a peek at the barber shop across the way
Once inside the police station note the six maps displayed on the wall off to your right they have some pretty diverse locations Mediterranean Far East the Eastern Seaboard of the US etc
Turn around and examine the four detective's desks located behind you
One desk has a poster showing a missing dog on it last seen near Sweeny's Meats oh Leo what did you do
The last desk on the left curiously has a row of six push pins corresponding to the names of six women
The pins can be picked up perhaps they're to be stuck into the maps somewhere
We'll need to come back to this
Go back towards the door to the station and then travel around the big desk and down a hallway to the morgue
Its empty continue off to the right to the jail cells
Click on each of the cells to get a close up of the personal item in each one
After continue to the far door and step though to the area behind the big desk
You will find a map of the police station here and well as six numbered keys corresponding to six women's names the same six names that were on the pushpins
Using the keys the map and the contents of the cells you can lay out the following information Cell Tess blue gloveCell Ophelia brown yarnCell Molly white fluteCell Lulu greyish blue cupCell Kitty flowery hatCell Ingrid blue earring This is a lot of information but it still doesn't tell us where to place those pins
Exit the cell block via the morgue and leave the police station in search of more clues
Passing the flower stand on your right enter the boarding house located to your left
The downstairs area is quite beautiful have a look at the piano in the main room and the old fashioned telephone in the room to the left
Proceed up the stairs there are six bedrooms located up here
Each room belonged to one of the six girls listed at the police station there is a personal effect and a postcard in each room to help us identify where the girls are from
From your perspective standing on the top of the stairs Armed with our location information leave the boarding house and return to the police station
Proceed over to the desk with the pins and place each pin in its proper location on the maps Once the pins are placed in the correct positions you are whisked into the locked room beyond the wall maps
A single rose lies on the desk in front of you
Pick up the rose and find yourself standing in from of the flower cart
Click on the cart to bring some of the flowers to life
Move off in the direction of the boarding house again but this time proceed past it and enter the pub straight ahead
Click on the draft tap handles for a close up of the designs on each
Pay particular attention to the logos colours and number of stripes
Now look around the pub
You find a set of six darts at each of the six booths within the pub as well as a fireplace and a dart board
Examine the darts closely the darts match the designs on the six tap handles but only one dart at each booth exactly matches the corresponding handle the others generally resemble the handles but differ somewhat
The object here is to throw the correct dart from each of the six booths after a correct dart is thrown the corresponding tap handle is pulled down
Throw one incorrect dart at then board and the other darts already in the board simply disappear requiring you to start again
If we number the booth closest to the dart board as and the one farthest from the board as and if we number the darts through running top to bottom in the dart box we get the following matches Once finished all six tap handles are pulled and the fireplace spins to reveal a passageway into the back alley
Proceed through the door ahead walk over to the boxing ring and pick up the rose on the stool
Click on the flower cart to grow more flowers
Go back towards the pub and proceed off to the left the streets to the right is a dead end

Go back outside and enter the boarding house again
Proceed to the left and click on the phone it's ringing
Answer the phone and listen to the threatening message from Muffy's kidnaper
Will Miss Pettibone be able to stay out of the morgue
Lets go find out
Return to the police station and go into the morgue
Sure enough Miss Pettibone's body is now laid out on the table
Click on the body to receive the final rose and add it to the cart
We are sent back to the ship in time to see Leo slip away his secrets finally revealed

A letter from Jan which arrived with a now missing necklace declares his fondness for her and mentions the word mirror several times in reference to the necklace
Belle's Hells Exit Claire's room and proceed across the hall to Belle's stateroom door
Unlock the door with and enter

Open her serum box marked with a feather and pick up the serum container
Take the serum down to the NG again enter the pod and click on the feather symbol to be transported into Belle's dream world
You find yourself standing on a raised level at one end of a sultan's palace
Go either left or right follow along the walls and descend to ground level
Proceed towards the back wall of the palace to the doors behind the large fountain
The walls of the sided room inside have frames to hold the pieces of a tapestry of which are empty
We will have to collect the ten missing pieces and return to this location
Back outside cross to the other side of the fountain turn to your right and proceed towards the set of blue doors located straight ahead
Once inside examine the five hookah pipes located at either ends of the room each pipe when activated emits a puff of smoke that forms into a symbol
The symbols include a spade an quot S quot a star a triangle and three vertical lines
Note the locations of the pipes and the symbols they create
Afterward enter the small chambers located about the room and collect the pieces of the tapestry located there of the rooms have the tapestry others are empty
Leave the room and proceed through another set of blue doors straight across the palace grounds

You must follow the maze of lines to determine the proper order of the symbols produced by the hookah pipes
Turn the obelisk until you see a small circle at the top with a line leading from it
Follow this line until you encounter all five symbols on the path
The order should be triangle vertical lines star quot S quot and spade
Return to the room containing the hookah pipes and activate the pipes in the order determined by the obelisk
Once completed you are given a feather click on the bell to see a mechanical bird flutter around
Proceed back down to ground level and return to the room behind the fountain

We must now place the pieces of the tapestry in the proper order to tell the story
Starting from the piece that is fixed the one located immediately to the right of the door place the pieces in order by clicking on the proper piece and carrying it over to the proper position
It's tough following the story the easiest way is to look for common items that span pictures e g
a set of mountains in the background may straddle two pieces of the tapestry
The proper order is shown below beginning with the fixed panel
Horseman attacks look for pink fence that runs into the next panel
Woman kneeling look for blue pink wall that runs hellip
Woman dancing for sultan look for edge of throne hellip
Battle look for bodies hellip
Santa Claus
kneeling look for brown path hellip
Man and woman sitting on carpet look for pink mountains hellip
White haired man comforting dying person

Morpheus is a game for Adventure game lovers
You will be submerged into a world somewhere between the Titanic not the game
and the Phantom of the Opera
This game is full of adventure many puzzles within puzzles and many different quot worlds quot or quot dreams quot to visit The game begins in the 's where you find yourself aboard a ship that has been icebound for nearly years in the Arctic
You play a character who is seeking out the truth behind the disappearance of your father
You find out much later in the game what has happened to him not to mention the others on the ship
The ship was especially designed by J C Pharris for his adopted son Jan and his experimentation with a machine he calls the Neurographicon machine
Six very special guests have been invited on the Herculania's maiden voyage
Unbeknownst to them they are about to embark on a personal crusade of Jans the adopted disfigured son of Jonathan Cleveland Pharris J C Pharris has spared no expense in accommodating his passengers and their needs and or wishes
Each passenger shares a quot history quot with Jan JC or each other in one aspect or another
Each of their rooms have been customized to their likes and dislikes
An Assistant Dr Malherbe is there to help Jan provide the correct herbal serum for each passenger so that they may take the quot journey into their dreams quot The Herculania began it's maiden voyage to the sea on November and ended it's journey stuck in the frozen ice days later
It has been stuck in the ice ever since
Where did everybody go
Were they rescued did they freeze to death or are they still aboard the ship
You will soon find out I found this game to be a WONDERFUL game and I very HIGHLY recommend this game to all who are as addicted to Adventure games as I am
You will not be disappointed
Many of the puzzles are somewhat difficult but by paying attention to the quot visions quot or quot flashbacks quot taking notes and sheer perseverance can be solved
A few of the puzzles I found quite difficult but managed to get them and finish the game You will NOT be disappointed in this game
That I promise Take care all and look for MORPHEUS to fly to the top
In my opinion this game has the potential to match Myst Riven Lighthouse Shivers and even Black Dahlia

Mourir En Mer To die at sea WALKTHROUGH June th Len Green lengreen hotmail com PREFACE This is a pretty short and generally easy freeware game produced by Daniel Muller ldquo Dorcan rdquo
The theme is unusual and it is rather harrowing and melancholy maybe even morbid
The game was made with French subtitles but these can be changed to English texts when performingsetup The English is faulty but good enough for comprehension
Daniel ldquo Dorcan rdquo emailed me that ldquo hellip hellip hellip
don't worry there are no sounds or music because I made this game in days for the MAGS competition hellip hellip hellip rdquo
The game is of the lsquo classic rsquo D rd person cartoon style point amp click genre It is fairly linear hellip but not completely so The interface is extremely simple and slick hellip the graphics are fairly crude There are save game slots and the whole load save mechanisms are very fast
In the first section of the game and when you are again in the attic the boy rsquo s father enters every to minutes real time and depending upon setup resolution system specs etc
Generally he just potters around with his toolbox but if he sees that his son is preparing to escape the game comes to an end and you have to reload a previous save hellip so save frequently during these sections The father seems generally unaware of most of his son rsquo s preparations There are only three situations which bring on this untimely stoppage of the game and NONE in other locations I have highlighted these three cases below in block capital letters BTW hellip I think you will find that the abovementioned times although they may appear to be very short are actuallyampleto carry out all designated tasks
All stepsnecessaryto finish the game successfully are included in the walkthru and nearly all of them areessential hellip but just a few marked in italics are lsquo optional rsquo and included to advance the logic of the narrative You do not need to stick to theorderoutlined below Of course some actionsmustbe performed before you can expedite certain others hellip but apart from that there is quite a degree of flexibility
Attic Take the dressmaker rsquo s dummy and place it on the mattress DO NOT PLACE THE BLANKET OVER THE DUMMY AND ONTO THE MATTRESS now OR THE RESULTS WILL BE DISASTROUS WHEN lsquo DAD rsquo ENTERS THE ATTIC
ALSO THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN IF YOUEVERATTEMPT TO ESCAPE OUT OF THE DOOR WHILST HE rsquo S THERE particularly when he rsquo s looking at the toolbox and his back is turned
Open the box underneath where the dressmaker rsquo s dummy was situated and take the scissors hellip they don rsquo t cut very well
Look at the broken mirror and locate the lsquo piece of mirror rsquo only a very few pixels and difficult to see hellip it rsquo s just a tiny bit above the empty centre of the mirror
Use the scissors on the piece of mirror and pick up the sharp piece of mirror glass
Open the cupboard and take the bedsheet
In inventory use the piece of mirror to cut the bedsheet into three pieces
In inventory join all three pieces of the bedsheet together to make a lsquo rope rsquo
Take the toolbox from the shelf ALL lsquo essential rsquo ITEMS MUST BE RETURNED TO THE TOOLBOX AND THE TOOLBOX ITSELF RETURNED TO THE SHELF BEFORE lsquo DAD rsquo ENTERS THE ATTIC OTHERWISE HE WILL SEE THAT IT rsquo S BEEN TAMPERED WITH hellip AND THE OUTCOME WILL BE VERY UNPLEASANT
In inventory look atthe toolbox three times The first time you obtain some nails the second time a hammer and the third time a small saw
Use the saw on the window rsquo s metal bars The saw blade breaks after cutting one bar only In inventory quickly return the nails and hammer to the toolbox you can rsquo t return the broken saw and replace the toolbox onto the shelf
Push the now weakened bars out of the window hellip leaving it empty and open
Throw your rope through the window
Now you must fix the rope in place inside the bedroom Repeat
In inventory look atthe toolbox twice The first time you obtain nails and the second time the hammer
Put some nails onto the rope The hammer will automatically nail the end of the rope firmly into the floor
Pick up the blanket
Whilst father rsquo s not there and so that your absence will go unnoticed quickly throw the blanket over the dressmaker rsquo s dummy on the mattress so that it appears you rsquo re still there and asleep
Again quickly use the rope to climb out of the window Free at last

Show give the ratburger to the cashier
Demand to speak and complain to the manager
Whilst she rsquo s gone to get him quickly grab her mobile phone
You get connected to the phone number at the rail station The Controller hears it but does nothing
Repeat and
This time the Controller answers
You are given four possible lines of dialog Choose one of them
If you haven rsquo t chosen the correct one then repeat and until youdo lsquo find it rsquo
The correct dialog is to tell the Controller that he rsquo s won dollars in some ldquo grand contest rdquo and that he is to wait in the phone booth for a few minutes until they phone back to him again
Leave the restaurant On the map choose the Train Station

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
Myst Island After the introduction you are left staring at the Myst book
Touch this book and it expands to fill your screen
Touch itagain and it will open to reveal a small picture window on the right page with no writing
If you wait a few seconds thepicture will spring to life with a flyby tour of Myst Island
Each Myst linking book will do this when opened
It is best to sitback and watch the video as it gives you a general lay of the land that will assist you in finding your way around a newage
Each age consists of a giant puzzle in the form of an island
To learn more about each of these ages consult thelocal library
The Family Tree You will not encounter many people in Myst
Atrus is the progenitor of Myst and all its ages
He uses an art he learnedfrom his father to link these ages together
It is never really explained but it seems that whatever Atrus writes in hisbooks becomes reality in the different ages
The one reference to this is in the Stoneship Age and the gift he gave to theboys there
It will become obvious later what went wrong with the ship Atrus created
Atrus has sons Sirrus andAchenar whom you will learn of early in your adventure in Myst and a dear wife Catherine who is apparently being heldhostage in another land
Where to Start
Myst Island is where you start the game First anything you encounter in Myst that can be manipulated should be
Inother words push all buttons flip all switches turn all dials and so forth
One thing is almost certain if it moves it hassomething to do with solving a puzzle
There are no one way manipulations everything can be returned to its originalstate
Your first objective on Myst Island is to locate all the marker switches and turn them to the up position
Theselook like podiums with large power switches set into the surface
They must all be activated to get off the island
On Your Marker You'll land on the dock after touching the page in the Myst book
To your left is the outline of a door set into the wall bythe dock
If you want open this door and go in
This is the dimensional imager that you will soon learn of
If you care toventure forth at this point go down the stairs and at the base turn to your right and click on the page on the wall
When itis in full view note the list of three items and their associated imager numbers Press the small blue button above and to the left of the page on the wall
This will slide open an access panel and allowyou to key in an imager code
Mirror Mirror Use the up and down arrows below each digit to set a code into the imager control panel
Now turn around and walk tothe imager
Set into its base is a yellow button which when pressed displays the image
When no code is set you willonly see what looks like water
After you're familiar with the workings of the imager it's time to leave Go back out to the dock and walk towards what looks like a large gear mechanism set on a hill at the top of some stairs At the base of the stairs you will encounter your first marker switch go ahead and flip it
Climb the stairs and flip themarker switch next to the large gear
What A View
Take a moment to catch your breath after climbing all those stairs and look around
Hmm there's a lot more to explore Go down the stairs towards the rotunda
On your way pick up the note on the grass
It's from Atrus to his wife Catherine It tells of a message that's left on the imager in the fore chamber by the dock
Sound familiar
Onward and back upward
The rotunda is used later to decode a sequence of star constellations
For now flip the marker switch to the leftof the door
Walk up the wood steps past the library right and out to the spaceship on the point
What A Blast
There's an elevated walkway leading out to the spaceship
Notice the brick tower to the left as you go out supporting apower line running to the spaceship you may be back for that switch later if you trip the breaker
Go out to thespaceship and flip on the marker switch
Go back to the library follow the grassy path away from the library towards thedistant Clock Tower
On your way you will find a large water filled marble basin with a miniature sunken ship Maybe this location holds the key to raising that ship
Flip on the marker switch just past the large marble basin and tothe left of the path
Power Plant As you've probably noticed the power line from the spaceship has been running parallel to the path just beyond thosestrange pillars
In front of each pillar is a raised metal marker with a bronze plate set into the face of each that vibratesand glows red when touched
Each plate has a symbol etched into it
Do not touch any of these plates just yet
Instead sketch each of the symbols etched into the plates Continue on down the path past the marble basin following the power line
Just off to the right is the entrance to theunderground power generation plant for the island which is where the power line ends
Shocking Go right and you will find the small brick building that houses the entrance to the underground power plant
For now flipon the marker switch to the left of the door
Don't worry you'll come back to this building in a bit
Notice there's anotherbrick tower with a breaker switch off behind the brick building
Go back to the path and head for the clock tower in thedistance
There's a control box just at the waters edge
On it there's a large and small dial as well as a red button
Thesedials set the time on the clock tower There's a marker switch out by the Clock Tower
Unfortunately you can't swim
Trees Through The Forest Therefore follow the shore around to the little log cabin
There's another marker switch to the right of the door
As usual flip it to the on position
That's a really large tree back behind the cabin
If you want go take a look at the big tree andpoke around the cabin
We'll be waiting for you when you get back here
That's the last marker switch on Myst Island Remember Catherine's letter
Enter the number of Marker Switches on this island into the imager to retrieve themessage
We've seen marker switches and were only able to activate
Go back to the imager by the docks to getthat message
Dear Catherine Remember the hidden image sequencer panel behind the fake piece of paper on the wall
Press the button and input thenumber
Turn walk to the imager and press the button
Atrus will appear and deliver his message
He tells of hislibrary being destroyed and how he suspects his sons
He tells Catherine that he's hidden the remaining undamagedbooks in their places of protection
He reminds Catherine that if she's forgotten the access keys to remember thetower rotation
Okay then hop it up to the library and do some research
After all wasn't that a tower that loomed abovethe library
The Book is Better Than the Movie Go into the library and directly to the bookshelf on the back wall
When it is in full view you will be able to read eachindividual book
Atrus was right most of these books are completely destroyed burned at the hands of an arsonist Which son could have done this
The Channelwood Journal is the first readable book it's red and green and is on the leftside of the top shelf
Take and read this book
Click on it once to bring it into full view and again to open it
Clicking on apage will turn it
This book tells of a land of tree dwellers
Each book will chronicle that land and show you some keydrawings of it
Channeling Channelwood looks like a land of tree houses
The next book that's still readable is the red and blue Stoneship AgeJournal on the right side of the top shelf
This book tells the story of boys and their adventures
Make note of thesubmersible lamp the lighthouse and the constellations of this land
These constellations have matching symbols likethose etched into the bronze plates mounted on the markers in front of the pillars that ring the marble basin area
Usethe empty journal provided with the game to sketch all pertinent information
Remember these books will give you manyclues to each of the ages
Apocalypse Now The next readable book is blue and is located on the middle shelf
This journal tells of the Selenitic Age and reads likethe Bible's Book of Revelations replete with a land scorched by giant balls of fire from the sky large craters andburned out wastelands Make note of the drawing of the keyboard and receiving dish
These items will play an important role later during yourtravels to this age It's a good idea to sketch the map of each age they will prove invaluable in your later travels
The next book makes littlesense
It's slightly singed but still readable
The Book Of Patterns At the far right side of the middle shelf is a book of many different block patterns
They all are based on a x grid Don't write these down
Instead remember what the patterns look like as you will need to reference this book later There's one more book that you can peruse
The brown book on the left side of the bottom shelf is the Mechanical AgeJournal
In it you will read of an island fortress and an attacking fleet of ships
Make note of how the fortress works thefortress floor plan and the stairs
Do not skip through these books
A little time spent reading here will save you a lot oftime later in the game
Son Tsu On the left wall of the library behold a red book on a display shelf with a red page sitting next to it
Open the book andinsert the red page in it to communicate with Sirrus
Through the heavy static and interference you can see that he isunsure of who you are
He appears to be well mannered though
As he struggles to see you he pleads for you to bringmore red pages
On the other wall you will find the book that contains Achenar
He seems a bit shall we say disturbed He like his brother demands that you bring more blue pages
We at last have a direction to proceed in this quest
Whatpurpose do these pages serve
Are We On The Map
The map on the left wall of the library holds the key to your travels through the different ages of Myst
Examine it
Whenyou are close enough all locations where you activated marker switches at are illuminated
Just behind the library youwill see a blinking circular marker
Press on this marker and a line will appear
If you hold down on the marker the linewill rotate
As it passes over key landmarks it will turn red
Release at the docks and you will hear creaks and groans asthe tower aligns with this location After that pretty impressive display and now that the tower is rotated what do you do
Secret Tower Passage There are framed pictures by the bookcase
On the left wall is a picture of a set of stairs on the right a set of bookshelves that look awfully familiar
Touch the picture of the stairs
The image will swirl and the shelf of books will slideaway to reveal a passage
At the end of that wood paneled hallway sits an elevator
Once in the elevator press the bluebutton to be delivered to the tower
The indicator above the button will display Tower when you arrive just to make sure Exit the elevator and go straight to the ladder that has an open book plaque behind it climb the ladder to the platform
I Can See Clearly Now Looking out the window the landmark highlighted during the tower rotation will be visible in this case the docks
Couldthis point the way to the place of protection for one of the remaining books Climb down and go to the other ladder
A key plaque is mounted on the wall behind it
Climbing to the top reveals yetanother plaque
This one gives dates and times am am and pm
Therotunda holds a decoder that will translate these dates
In order to leave the library return to the pictures and touch thebookcase picture to close the passage
It's A Date Start with a quick trip to the rotunda building
Open the door and go in
Next to the door is a switch that will turn off thelights
Click the whole room then looks like a planetarium
Take a seat in the chair and pull down the control panel
Inputthe dates from the key platform plaque
Each date will display a constellation that will match one of the drawings in thejournal
The matching symbol icons from this translation will be Leaf Snake and Beetle
Go down to the marble basinand find the columns with these icons
Press the matching bronze plates for these symbols and they'll turn green
Raise The Titanic Upon pressing the last plate a loud rush of water will be heard like something big is draining
Aha the ship in the birdbath raised
But that couldn't have made all that noise
What about the bigger ship
Yes
The ship by the dock is alsoraised
Board it and go below deck to find the first linking book on the blue chair
Open it and watch the flyby of theStoneship Age
Touch the picture and you will be taken there
You'll find yourself standing at the aft of a ship thatappears to have materialized on a large stone island
A wood plank leads out to a sunken lighthouse to the right and anumbrella structure to the left
Walk the Plank There are several objectives on this island
First restore power to the island structures
Walk out to the umbrellastructure where there are large buttons
Pressing the right button will pump out the lighthouse
Return there and findthe key chained to the walkway
Down the spiral stairs is a large locked trunk
A small valve is set in the left side of thetrunk open it to drain the trunk then close it and return to the pump switches
Press the right button and return to thelighthouse
The trunk is floating alongside the key that's bolted to the walkway
Unlock the trunk and remove the keyhidden inside
Going Up Climb the ladder to the right of the chest
Use the key and open the attic door
There's a hand generator here and abattery pack
Crank the handle on the generator several turns until the power gauge on the battery pack shows solidwhite i e you have a full charge
Go back to the pump station and press the middle button
This drains the tunnels inthe large rock structure
Sirrus' room is down the passage leading from the aft platform where you entered this age Look around this ornate area
There's lots to look at but all you need to recover is the single red page in the bottomdresser drawer
Return To Myst Island There's a telescope at the pinnacle of the rock formation at the center of this island
Just to the left of the walkway to thelighthouse there is a stone passage which you should follow as it leads up to the telescope
Look through the telescopeand pan around
Stop on the roof of the lighthouse with the blinking light
This will be at the degree mark
Go backdown the passage to Sirrus' room
On the wall landing up from either brothers room will be a large recessed plate Pressing it will reveal a secret passage to the compass room
On the floor of this room is a large antique compass
Nowyou're getting somewhere Due East Circling this compass are a series of small buttons Press the th button from the north portion but beware
If you press the wrong one you will trip the lights and have togo back up to the lighthouse to recharge the battery pack
A light goes on if you press the right button
How strange thelight is underwater and can be seen through the windows in this room
Time to go back up to the pump station
Press theleft button and the aft ship chamber will drain
Go below deck and note that the light you just activated with the compassbutton is illuminating this room
At the bottom of the hold is a book room
Go to the table
Can I Check Out This Book
Touch the table top and the linking book will materialize
Remember you can go into any of the chambers without thebenefit of light
Both bedchambers appear to have independent energy sources and are lit up regardless of batterycharge
However if the underwater light is not lit the book will not appear on the table
With the Myst linking book beforeyou open it and touch the picture to return to the library on Myst Island
Insert the red page in the red book and listen toSirrus
He thanks you for the page and tells you that his brother is guilty and that he is wrongfully imprisoned imploringyou to bring more pages
Back For The Blue Page The return trip is a breeze
Just go down to the ship by the dock below deck use the linking book and you're back inthe Stoneship Age
Recharge the battery pack and press the middle button at the pumping station to drain the centerpassages
Off the fore section of the ship is a passage leading down to Achenar's bed chamber
Achenar is not at all likehis brother
From the looks of his room you might say that he is a little on the twisted side
There's a lamp that looksstrangely like a human rib cage
There on the bed is the blue page
Off to side of the room is a large dresser with astrange apparatus perched on top
Only Half The Story On top of the dresser is a holographic unit Turn it on and a rose appears slide the lever and it morphs into a human skull
The second from the bottom drawer ofthis dresser has a surprise
This is the left half of a torn page from a journal something to do with marker switches anda vault
This could be important so make a note of its contents
With the blue page in hand go to the pumping stationand press the left button
Return to the book room and use the linking book to return to Myst Island
In the library returnthe blue page to the blue book and listen to Achenar
He seems to be getting crazier doesn't he
Rubber Room Achenar says that his brother cannot be trusted that he was falsely imprisoned and that he will seek retribution for hisbrother's acts
The image is clearer this time with less static
Maybe the more pages returned to the books the betterthe communications link
With the way Achenar is cracking up though how well do you want that link to be
Use themap to rotate the tower again
This time position the rotating pointer to the spaceship out on the point
Sure enough looking out from the tower shows the spaceship in view
The key plaque displays a single message volts
Keep thatnumber current
Snacks Are Available In The Lobby A trip to the power plant seems to be in order
The trip down the hill from the library is quick enough
Go in the brickbuilding and down to the door at the bottom then press the blue button and go in the door
There's a control panel with switches in columns
There are also dials the left is for island power the right for power to the spaceship
Eachswitch powers up a generator
The trick is to flip the right combination of switches to total volts on each dial
To dothis press button and on the left column and buttons and on the right carefully
The number should now bedisplayed on each dial
What A Trip If you press the wrong combination of switches you will trip of the tower breakers
If this occurs shut down allgenerators go out find the tripped breaker and then start again
Once you hit the s enter the space ship and you willsee a keyboard at one end and a set of slider switches and a lever at the other end
Using the diagram from theSelenitic Age Journal of the keyboard press the key from the diagram and then adjust the first slider so that the notegenerated matches the note played on the keyboard
Repeat for each of the notes
When you think you have the rightsettings pull the handle
Music To The Ears If the settings were correct the linking book should now be displayed in the view screen
Touch the screen and watch aflyby of the Selenitic Age which is pretty desolate
Like the first puzzle sounds must be identified and set into anaccess panel before you can return to Myst Island
Like the marker switches on Myst Island there are soundtransmitters scattered about at locations that must be activated
Locate each and press the button
Make a note ofeach icon at each transmitter's site
Also note the sound that emanates from each location
WARNING This is possiblythe most difficult of all the puzzles of Myst
An Oasis Cross the elevated walkway and follow the path through the pass to the left of the mountain
Set into the base of themountain is a small brick structure with a coded access panel
The first small trail that branches left off the main trailleads around the left side of a large crater
Follow it to the oasis
It is here that you will find the blue page on a woodbench to the left of the transmitter switch
Take it
The icon at this transmitter location is of drops of water
Press thered button and listen to the sound of the water you will need to remember this sound later
Water To Fire Go back to the large brick staircase just past the Oasis trail head
This leads to the chasm Atrus spoke of in his journalof this age
Activate this transmitter switch and make a note of the sound of the furnace below
The icon at this locationis a chasm with steam rising
Go back down the stairs and continue down the path away from oasis and chasm
You willquickly come to the remnants of a once mighty clock tower
Activate the transmitter switch
Listen and note the sound ofthe clock
The icon here is of clock hands
Continue down to the fork in the path go right and up the hill towards thecrystal forest
Crystal Forest In the crystal forest you will find another transmitter switch
There's a unique sound produced here as the wind whistlesthrough the crystal formations
The icon here is of a shard of crystal
There's a red page sitting atop the transmitterpedestal so pick it up
Where did the blue page go
Return to the path and walk out to the jetty to a subsurface tunnel The loud rush of wind exiting the tunnel is almost deafening
Activate the transmitter switch
The icon is a hole with airswirling out
Next climb down the ladder into the underground tunnel
Turn on the light switch at the ladder's base
The Light at the End of the Tunnel Climb the ladder at the other end of the tunnel then climb the brick stairs to a large set of metal doors
Open the doorsto expose a control panel complete with video monitor directional arrows a receiver coordinates display iconbuttons that match the transmitter icons and a sum button
The trick here is to rotate the receiver to lock in on eachindividual transmitter
When you get close a directional arrow will flash in the direction of the signal
You will hear a clearsound played over the speaker when the right direction is locked in IMPORTANT Record the direction coordinates foreach icon
The Coordinates The various coordinates are Oasis Chasm Clock Tower Crystal Forest and the UndergroundTunnel
Once all coordinates are set press the sum button and the sounds will be played back in a specificsequence Crystal Forest Oasis Underground Tunnel Chasm and Clock Tower
Return to the access panel back at thestart of this age
By moving the sliders different sounds will play
Set the sliders so the sounds play in the samesequence as above
When all the sliders are set press the red button to open the doors
Go down the stairs to the railcar
Press the blue button and go in and take a seat
Which Way Do I Go
Press 'FORWARD' to start your trip in the rail car Once lowered to the track use the directional arrows to set a compass direction forward to move forward and backtrackto reverse your last movement
The correct sequence of directions is N W N E E S S W SW W NW NE N SE and exit At the end of the ride exit and follow the passage There you will find the Myst linking book so use it to return to Myst Island
Back in the library place the red page in thered book
Sirrus is easier to see and hear now with another page inserted
He begs that you bring more pages and warnsyou not to release his brother
The Blue Page The return trip is easy this time
The code is still set in the spaceship so simply use the already displayed linking bookto travel to the Selenitic Age
Return to the oasis and retrieve the blue page
When you go back to the maze entrance the sliders are still set
Press the button and go down to the rail car which has magically returned to the start of themaze
Run the exact same directions through the maze
Use the Myst linking book to return to the library and insert theblue page into the blue book
Achenar now claims that Sirrus murdered their father and commands you to bring morepages
The plot thickens Have you come to any conclusions
Which brother is sane and which is really guilty
How did they get into theirseparate books anyway
Why are their pages scattered throughout the lands of Myst
So many questions and so fewanswers
Maybe you will find some more answers in the remaining ages of Myst
If not how will you decide whichbrother to release
Your decision will ultimately lead to either your escape or permanent residency
Trained Mechanics You've probably already guessed which landmark holds the linking book to the Mechanical Age it's the large set of gearson the hill above the docks
Using the map in the library rotate the tower to align with this spot
A trip to the tower willshow proper alignment and disclose the key
That first part is a time and where is time used on Myst Island The controls on the shore by the Clock Tower of course
After arriving at the control box turn the dials for hours andminutes to set the clock to
Press the red button and a hidden walkway of gears will rise from the water
What Was The Combination
Inside the tower is a strange device
It consists of numbered dials in a vertical stack and at the base are levers oneither side one on the wall to the right and a counter weight on a chain to the left
Pull and release the lever on the leftand the bottom dials will rotate digit
Pull and hold this lever and the bottom number dial rotates position while themiddle dial continues to rotate until released
Pull and release the right lever and the top dials rotate position
Pulland hold the right lever and the top number rotates position and the middle dial continues to rotate until released Simple right
Get It In Gear You are limited on the number of times you can pull the levers because as you rotate dials the counterweight drops
If ithits the ground you have to pull the lever on the wall to reset the dials and raise the counterweight
The quickest solutionto this puzzle is Pull and release right lever twice
Hold the left lever down until the comes around on the middle dial then release the lever
There will be a cranking sound as a mini gear set in the base of the device rotates open
It looks alot like the larger gear on the hill by the docks
Time to get up there and check if it has opened like this miniature modelhas
Fortress Island Sure enough the gear is open and the linking book is just inside
Use it to get to the Mechanical Age a place full ofgears
Upon arrival to your left is a gear set on a pedestal with a control panel
There are icons that can be changed bypressing the green buttons
There's also a large red button under the row of icon buttons
Across a steel foot bridge sitsa small fortress set on yet more gears
The track that encircles the fortress and the long trap door guarded by railings look just like a few of the drawings in Atrus journal of this age
Cross the foot bridge to the fortress and go right onceinside
Around And Around We Go Achenar's room is even weirder than those found in the other ages
There are all sorts of weapons laying aboutsurrounded by strange wall decorations
There's a fortress rotation simulator here
By manipulating the levers you willsee a graphic of the fortress rotate through the compass directions
When you find the real rotation device you will nothave the benefit of a graphic display
Practice enough to be able to do this with your eyes closed
Listen carefully to thedirectional sounds
There's a recessed panel to the right of the simulator marked by a yellow stripe press on this paneland enter the secret chamber
Torture Chamber The Blue page is beneath a shelf with poison bottles
Find the other exit from the bed chamber follow it to the end andyou will be at the back entrance of Sirrus' room
Midway between these is a red button and another hallway
Thereappears to be a column at the end of the hallway
Pressing the red button opens a door in the floor In the lower level there's a small table with a display of semicircles with set inside the other and a lever
Pull thelever and rotate the circles lining up the openings then return upstairs
Push the red button again to close the stairs andgo down the hall to the elevator
Going Up The elevator has an up and down arrow with a square button set in the middle that serves as a timer
Go to the top floorand press the timer
Exit the elevator and when the timer expires the elevator will close and lower out of sight revealingthe rotation device
Use the device to rotate and visit the islands north and east of this one
On each you will find half ofthe icon sequence needed to open the stairway at the start of this age
Return the tower to it's original location south and use this icon code sequence to open the stairway
Finally go down to the room and use the linking book to returnto Myst Island
Mental Case Back at Myst Island insert the blue page in the blue book
Achenar gets a little further down the road to the bigrubber walled room on each return trip
He of course wants more blue pages so what else is new
He tells of Sirrusbeing the guilty party
He explains how Sirrus has a greed that cannot be quenched
Most of the conversation is thesame old paranoid babble that only Achenar seems capable of vocalizing
Get back to the gear on the hill and theMechanical Age linking book
Once back at the island again cross the catwalk to the fortress go left inside the door This will take you to Sirrus' room
Sirrus' Stuff Sirrus' room is filled with miniature models of all the devices on Myst Island
Each can be closely examined
Since thefortress is symmetrical it only makes sense that there would also be a hidden room here
Below and to the right ofSirrus' throne behind the tapestry is where the panel is located
Here is where his greed manifests itself in the goldbars and coins that litter the room
Laying in a chest of gold bars in the back corner of the room is a red page
There's athreatening note rolled up with the wine bottles from Achenar
Return to Myst Island with the fourth red page and insert itinto the red book
The Fourth Red Page Sirrus actually seems a little calmer
With each page he says he can see more clearly and that soon he will be free ofhis prison
He sure is appreciative of the red pages and promises great wealth if the last one is retrieved
As is alwaysthe case with these brothers he minces no words where his brother's concerned
He claims that Achenar is dementedand took advantage of their father
He warns that if released Achenar will destroy both of you
He is anxious for the lastpage to be returned from the last unexplored age
The only other landmark that will activate the tower is the large tree
Channelwood Age Use the map in the library to rotate the tower to the large tree behind the small cabin just up from the Clock Tower
Aquick check through the window in the tower confirms the tower position and the key plaque only displayed the numbers
What the heck could those numbers mean
Just inside of the door and to the left in the small log cabin by thelarge tree is a wall safe
Setting the three tumblers to and pulling the handle opens the safe
There's a box ofmatches in the safe
Is anything on this island normal
Before leaving the wall safe strike the match on the box to igniteit
Things will heat up soon
Fire It Up Turn around and go to the furnace
Start by cranking the large wheel to the right to get the gas going then touch thematch to the pilot set in the lower left of the furnace base
Keep cranking the gas up until the temperature readout gaugeis maxxed out
The loud thundering sound is the tree moving up out of the base
Cut the gas and run out to the tree andyou will be able to jump into a compartment set in the tree for a ride down
At the bottom there's a room with theChannelwood Age linking book sitting on a tree stump
Use this book to get to the Channelwood Age
Just as the journalhad stated this place is filled with trees
Myst Family Robinson There are levels to the Channelwood Age the water level walkways the mid level huts and the upper level bedchambers of Achenar and Sirrus
The lower level is a very simple tree structure branching out from the windmill
Themid level huts are mapped in the Channelwood Age Journal and the upper level consists of a winding walkway thatconnects the brothers' bed chambers
Also on this level is Achenar's imaging chamber
All mechanisms in this age arepowered by a series of water pipes that emanate from the windmill
The windmill is to your left at the start of this age soyou'd best make your way there
Open The Valve Inside the windmill there's a water valve at the base of a large tank
Open the valve and you will hear the water run intothe pipes
All through this level you will know if the pipes at your feet are filled with running water by the sound nosound no water
Also at each fork of the walkway there's a way valve
Move the red valve bar parallel to the pipe youwant the water to go down
The spiral staircase seems like the logical way up but the door is locked with no key
Fromthe windmill route the water left then right times
This will bring you to an elevator
Use the red lever in the elevator togo up
Open Sesame On the drawing of the middle level in the Channelwood Age Journal there's a line connecting a hut to the spiral staircase Go straight from the elevator then right times then out to the hut with the switch for the spiral staircase door on themiddle level
Pull the red handle to open the door
From this switch hut go straight through the first hut right times through the square hut elbow through the next square hut and straight to the staircase
Go down the staircase andopen the door on the first level
Go back to the first fork from the windmill and redirect the water right to the spiralstaircase
Top Of The World Go up the spiral staircase and use the elevator to the left at the top of the stairs which now has power
This will takeyou to the top level and the bed chambers
Leave the elevator and head for the first hut that's visible
This is another ofAchenar's play rooms Achenar is a sick puppy
There's an imager that will activate when you enter the room although ithas no real purpose
Continuing on past this hut will bring you to Achenar's bed chambers and the master control for theimager
Flip through the messages and see the nice message from Sirrus
The fifth blue page is at the base of theimaging controller
Linking Paths At the other end of the winding walkway is Sirrus' bed chamber we'll come back for the red page later
Go back downthe elevator and staircase to the first level
Return to the first valve after the windmill and set the valves left twice thenright to a dead end with a lever
Pull the red handle and a hidden walkway will float up
Follow the walkway in a half circlepast the elevator and around to another dead end
Turn the crank here to extend a hidden pipe and connect it to theother side
Go back to the first valve again and set the valves left right twice and then left
Go back to the elevatoracross the floating bridge
Return Trip Go up the elevator to the Myst linking book
Use it to return to the library
Insert the blue page and wait for psycho boy tobe freed
Achenar will speak of yet another page and a trap
He warns of a green book that is a trap
To get to his finalpage pattern number from the odd book of patterns in the library must be entered in the fireplace located here in thelibrary
Before getting this last page go back and get the blue page left behind
Retrace the path and actions through thelog cabin the large tree and all the valve settings to get back up to the top level of Channelwood
Sirrus' Room Exiting the elevator swing left and go to the hut at the opposite end from Achenar's
As always the room is the model ofperfection
The sought after page can be found in the desk drawer under the window with a view of the windmill
In theright drawer under the bed is the other half of the page found earlier giving instructions for access to the hidden vault onMyst Island
Seems there are now things to do back on Myst Island
By now the way back is easy
Reset the valvesyet again to power the linking book elevator and return to Myst Island insert the red page in the library for the otherstory
Sirrus ly Now Sirrus now owes a debt of gratitude for returning the fifth page
He still claims that he is the innocent party and that hisbrother should not be released for both of your safety
The secret code on page is given along with another direwarning about not touching the green book
Follow the directions on the reassembled journal page
Go to the dock andturn the marker switch off all the others should still be on not off as written on the page this is important
There ina secret compartment in the base of the marker switch sits a white page
But there are no white books
Mu hu ha ha ha The plot thickens
Stoke Up A Fire Go back to the library and get the code book middle shelf far right
Carefully turn to page
Sketch this pattern andgo over to the fireplace on the right wall by the blue book
Crawl in and hit the red button to the left of the opening Pressing on the metal plate that drops down will raise squares on the metal duplicate the pattern found on page Push the red button again and the fireplace rotates around to a small chamber
Here sits the last pages and a greenbook
Let's see both brothers are more than a little whacked
If they both warned you not to touch the green book whatshould you do
The Question If you really are a glutton for punishment go back and insert the blue and red pages into the brothers' books
You willquickly know what it feels like to be imprisoned in a book and watch anxiously as each brother removes your pages whilehaving the last laugh
If you instead open the green book you will get to meet Atrus in person and hear the true story You'll know what to do with the white page after Atrus is done talking
If you hurried through Myst using this walkthrough or you just want to go do some sight seeing in some of the best graphics available on a PC use the book Atrus givesyou to go back to Myst
An Open Book All the ages of Myst are open now for you to explore
Atrus did say that he would summon you when he needed yourassistance to rescue his wife can you say sequel
Go back to the library and at least take a look at the brothers'final fate which shows that you don't want to get on Atrus' bad side
This concludes the Myst walkthrough but there aremany things to see in this game that were not touched upon here
While they do not play a key role in solving the game many of the items are very detailed and you may spend considerably more time just exploring Myst
Enjoy
GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
Myst A WalkthroughByDan KennedyNovember Your Virtual Tour Falling
Listen to Atrus speak as his book falls into the starry chasm
Once the book lands give it a mouse click and wait for it to open up
Watch the island flyover mini movie play on the first page
Should we touch the picture
Of course hellip oops looks like we've been transported toMyst Island
Your starting point on the island is thedock
Since this game is about immersion and exploration feel free to wander around and get to know the island
Try your hand at some of the puzzles and fiddle with knobs and such If you want to dive right into the story and start solving puzzle skip down to the Getting Started section below
Otherwise let's take a tour of our new surroundings
Don't worry about getting lost the island is relatively small and a few clicks will most likely get you back somewhere that you recognize
Leave the dock via the rounded staircase straight ahead and go to the right up a longer staircase to thelookoutpoint with what looks like a gigantic gear sticking out of it
By now you've noticed the woodensignal markersthat are located at various points around the island there's one at the lookout and one on the dock near the stairs
A click raises the switch on the top of the marker which effectively turns the signal marker on and another click lowers the switch turning the marker off
More about that later
Go back down the stairs past the dock and turn right to go up towardstwo buildings both on your right as you travel up the incline
The first building located next to another signal marker is round and contains what looks like a dentist chair
The other a little further along the path is sided and contains books some pictures a fireplace and a map
Back outside go to your right again you'll see aSpaceshipoff in the distance along a raised walkway there's another signal marker by the Spaceship as well
You can also veer off to the left down towards the brick tower that supports some electrical wires running from the Spaceship
Go back up the hill to the octagonal building and go to the right towards thewater basinsurrounded by small boxes on platforms and another signal marker
Each box has a symbol on it that glows red when the mouse cursor passes over it
There's a sunken ship in the fountain more about this later
Go four clicks past the basin and turn to your right here's the entrance to a smallbrick building plus another signal marker
Notice a second brick tower hidden behind and to the right of the small brick building
Return to the path and go towards the big waterloggedclock click once ahead and turn to the left here's a smallwooden buildingwith equipment inside plus another signal marker by the door
Behind the cabin off to the right is a path and staircase up to atall treesurrounded by a fence
Interesting
Backtrack and go towards that clock to check out the last destination on the island
Notice that the final eighth signal marker on the island is located beside the clock looks like it's untouchable for now
Getting Started Did you notice that note on the ground as you came up the hill from the dock towards the round building
If not its time to go find it the note is located on your left going towards the dock or on your right moving away from the dock
Click on the note and read the message from Atrus to Catherine if your name isn't Catherine then obviously the note's not for you but feel free to be nosy anyway
Go back to the dock to the end opposite the stairs and turn to your right
Click on the door and go down the staircase into the fore chamber
Altered Images Go to the imager the round basin with the water image displayed
Try pressing the button located on the front of the imager the water changes to a grid with circular markings
Hit the button again and the water image returns
Turn around towards the stairs again
Notice the shiny spot on the wall just left of the staircase
Click on it it's a list of numerical commands for the imager
Hit the hard to see button just up and to the left of the list and a numerical entry panel comes into view
Currently the dial shows quot quot which matches the quot Water Turbulent Pool quot setting
You can try changing the setting to Marker Switch Diagram quot quot and Topographic Extrusion Test quot quot by changing the numbers using arrow buttons to view them click on the red light to close the panel go back to the imager and click on the button on the front
But what about Atrus' message to Catherine
For that we need the number of marker switches on the island which we already counted as eight lookout round building water basin Spaceship brick building wood building dock water clock
Punch in quot quot into the panel close it hit the imager button and listen to the message
Catherine is Atrus' wife and their two sons are up to no good
He also mentions something about the quot tower rotation quot
Time to hit the sided library building
Leave the dock go up the hill past the round building and into the library
The Library Room Shh
There is quite a bit of material to go through in the library so if you don't relish the thought of some journal reading you could probably just skip the books in the bookcase entirely
Approach the room's bookcase and try clicking on a few of the books most if not all should be burned beyond repair as Atrus mentioned
There are however five books that can be perused
The contents of all but one of the books are journal entries of Atrus' travels try to soak up some of the atmosphere and the story but don't worry too much about the specific details or sketches
The first book with a vertical green and red spine near the left end of the top shelf tells of Atrus' first visit to another world of water and trees called theChannelwood Age
Keep in mind that Atrus originally constructed this world and the others you'll be visiting by writing a book about it however the book you are reading is simply a journal of his travels there
The second book with a vertical grey spine near the right side of the top shelf speaks of Atrus' visits to theStoneship Age and a few of his experiments with altering worlds after he created them i e
the failed ship in his story
You'll need to access the constellation maps and symbols at the end of the book later on do those symbols look familiar to you
The third journal with an angled blue spine on the second shelf describes a world that Atrus created which was not particularly stable theSelenitic Age
Be sure to copy down the piano keyboard as it is shown in the journal this information will be very important a little later on
The fourth book a brown horizontal spine on the bottom shelf tells of theMechanical Age and Atrus' attempts to help the people there defeat an enemy
Note that Atrus makes mention of a number of other ages throughout the journals but we will only be visiting these four during the course of the game
The fifth and final book the burnt book at the right end of the middle shelf contains pages of a strange grid like code
You'll need this much further along in the game
Meet the Brothers Grim Move on to the Blue book located walls to the right of the bookcase
Click on the book and click again to open it up all you get is static
Close the book and now try picking up the page beside the book
Click on the book to add the page and open it up to see a very static y message from Achenar he seems a bit off his rocker but wants you to bring more blue pages
Try the same routine with the red book located across the room
This time you'll meet Sirrus who certainly seems more even keeled that his brother
Sirrus wants the red pages brought to him
Map o' Myst Have a look at the map of the island located to the left of the red book
If you haven't turned on any of the signal markers on the island the only highlighted areas of the map will be the library and a blinking circle representing the island's tower
If you've turned on any of the accessible signal markers already the corresponding landmark will be displayed
This is a good time to go back out to turn on any markers that you have not done yet
Return to the map in the library all seven of the landmarks should be highlighted
Try pressing the left mouse button on the blinking tower symbol a line coming from the blinking circle will rotate around the island and TOWER ROTATION will appear at the bottom of the map
Notice during the rotation that the line turns red when it is over one of four locations the Spaceship the Lookout the Dock and the Tree behind the wood building
Listen to the tower creak and moan afterward as it changes position
Now its time to travel to the four Ages
Note that you do not have to visit the ages in the order that I have listed them here
However remember that once you transport to an Age you cannot return to Myst until you find another Myst linking book
A note about the pages if you are holding one loose page red or blue and click on another the second replaces the first in your grasp
The original page will immediately be transported back to the location you found it in
Selenitic Age A Shocking Clue The Selenitic Age is accessed via the Spaceship
Let's first have a look at it through the tower
Revolve the Tower so that the rotation line on the map lies directly above the location of the Spaceship in the top right corner of the island the line should turn red when it is in the right position
To get to the island tower move walls over to your right and click on the picture of the wood staircase
Right away the picture does a swirly dance and the bookcase immediately to your right folds down into the floor revealing a passage
Also note that the building's exit is now blocked you will have to click on the picture of the doorway located immediately to the right of the bookcase in order to close up the passage and reopen the door
Proceed down the new hallway until you reach an elevator get in and press the button to the right of the door
The elevator will creak upwards and let you out on the Tower level
Go up the ladder located immediately in front of you its beside a quot book quot symbol on the wall and enjoy a view of the Spaceship
Turn around and go back down the ladder
Walk around the level to the opposite side of the tower where an identical ladder is located by a quot key quot symbol on the wall
Again proceed up the ladder and jot down what is written on a plaque on the wall Volts
Go back down the ladder take the elevator back down to the Library level and go back out the passageway to the library room
Click on the doorway picture to open up the outside door again and go back outside
Fight the Power If you've already visited the Spaceship you know that the door is locked and you have probably seen the wires running from the Spaceship back to the brick building located past the water basin
We gotta power this sucker up
Walk past the water basin and turn to your right to access the brick building
Go in the doorway down the long staircase and open the door at the bottom by pressing the button to the right
Straight ahead is a power control panel for the Spaceship's generators
A guide to the control panel is posted on the wall to the right of the door behind you
According to the tower plaque volts are required to power up the Spaceship
Too much power and we'll overload the system and have to reset it
The buttons for the individual generators however are not marked so we are not sure what combination of buttons will get us to volts
Some trial and error will show that pressing each button adds a certain amount of voltage to both the Power and Power to Spaceship dials
If we number the buttons one through ten with Buttons and along the top row through Buttons and along the bottom row the voltages associated with each button are as follows volts volt volts volts volts volts volts volts volts and volts
Several combinations of these buttons will get the Power to Spaceship gauge up to exactly volts for example the combinations of Buttons and will do the trick or Buttons and will also work
If for whatever reason you add in too many volts the Power to Spaceship gauge will go back to zero and you will have to reset the electrical system before trying again
To reset the system you have to first turn off all of the generators then go to both of the brick electrical towers on the island climb them via a conveniently placed ladder and pull down on the handle located at the top of each tower
The first tower is in plain sight when looking towards the Spaceship's elevated walkway just go left towards the tower to access it
The other tower is a little more hidden stand facing the door to the brick building and click immediately to the right of the building to get to the second tower
Remember to pull down on those reset handles with some force the system had not reset until you hear a distinct clicking sound at each tower after pulling the handle
Tickling the Ivories Proceed directly to the Spaceship and open the door
We now have to input an aural access code into the mechanism to your left as you walk in
You'll also notice a piano conveniently placed opposite the mechanism
According to Atrus' journal sketch you have five piano notes to play marked in order to on the piano keyboard they are easy to find since the left side of the keyboard drawing corresponds to the left side of the keyboard on the ship
What makes this puzzle difficult is that you have to reproduce the exact same five notes on the other piece of equipment in the Spaceship
The notes must be set using the sliders located on the front of the equipment again in order to
Pull down the lever to the right to see whether you've got the right five notes if you do a linking book will appear in the window above allowing you to enter the Selenitic Age
If not try again
A lot of people have trouble with this puzzle namely people that have hearing difficulties or who are just plain tone deaf
I suggest you beg or borrow a musical instrument say a keyboard or guitar and use it to quot transfer quot the right note from the piano over to the sliders
Or ask a musically inclined friend for help
Once you solve the puzzle click twice on the book to reach the Selenitic Age
You've arrived in a rocky sunny world
Proceed along the walkway yes the door shuts behind you and you can't get back into the Spaceship until you reach dry land and turn to your right to check out a doorway
Notice the entry panel on closer inspection it looks very similar to the music panel in the Spaceship
Try pressing the bottom right button a whistling sound is heard times
Looks like you need a series of five sounds played in order to get in
We'll have to come back later
Turn it On Go ahead one click on the path and turn to your left
Take the path straight ahead go up and down the stairs across a bridge and up a short treed incline towards a water basin with a dish suspended above
You'll also see a small table with a red button on it press the button to activate the signal dish for the water basin
Note the symbol here dripping water
Turn around and note the location of ablue page gee Achenar will be happy
Go back along the path to its starting point
Turn to your left and go towards the water
Turn left again and climb the stairs to another signal dish this one is for the lava bubbling away below
Activate it by hitting the red button note the symbol here and retrace your steps
This time keep going straight towards those big clocks in the distance
There should be another signal dish to turn on for the ticking clocks hit the button and note the symbol
Back on the path click two steps forward and turn to the right
Follow this path into the chiming crystals and activate the signal dish there note the symbol again and the fact that there is ared pageby the red button go Sirrus
Retrace your steps back to the main path and go right
Continue along this path until you reach the fifth signal dish and activate it this one is for the whistling wind
You will also note that there is a ladder sticking out of a vertical passageway
Go down three steps and turn the light switch to the up on position the switch is on your left
Turn around and travel along the underground passage until you reach another ladder and go up to surface
Climb up the short staircase and click on the two metal doors to reveal a piece of equipment with several buttons and a view screen
Searching for Sound This equipment can be used to find the precise compass direction of each of the sounds that we activated the signal dishes for clicking clocks chiming crystals whistling wind dripping water and bubbling lava
First press one of the five symbol buttons for instance if you want to search for the clock sound you must press the clock button beforehand and use the left and right arrow buttons to change the compass direction
Once you get within degrees of the sound's location you will begin to hear the sound over the general hiss of the sound system and one of the two directional arrows will blink to point you in the direction to turn
Note that you must find the one and only compass point where the sound is crystal clear with no interference
A good sound to start with is the clocks they are easy to spot
Hit the clock symbol button the middle one and using the arrow keys pan across the horizon the clocks should come into plain view
Once you get close listen for the ticking sound and follow the blinking green arrow to make your move
The precise location of the clock sound is at degrees
The lava sound is also in plain sight to the right of the clocks at degrees and the wind signal dish can easily be seen as well degrees
The other two sounds are harder to find since the dishes aren't really visible
The chiming crystal sound is found to the left of the clocks at degrees and the dripping water sound is found just to the right of the lava sound at degrees
Remember to change the symbol button each time you search for a new sound
Once you've located the five sounds exactly press the big button at the bottom of the panel if you've got the five sounds located perfectly it will play them in an order that you must jot down chiming crystal water wind lava and clocks we'll need the order to get into the locked doorway you passed earlier
On your way back to the locked door go back to the chiming crystals and pick up the red page by the signal dish
You will carry it until you link back to Myst Island
Back at the doorway click on the panel and adjust each of the five sliders to play the sounds in order
Note that there are a number of other sounds on each slider so try not to get confused
Once you've got the order correct press the button and the door should slide open
Proceed in down the stairs and around the corner to the underground train car
Booo
Underground Maze Press the blue button to the right of the door to open it and step into the car
Sit down in the pilot's seat and press the button marked quot FORWARD quot
Your car will be lowered into the starting point of the tunnel maze
From each point in the maze there are eight sets of tracks leading away from your car corresponding to the directions north south east west northeast northwest southeast and southwest
You can always tell which direction you are facing by the abbreviated direction displayed on the right
You can rotate your car to face a different direction by clicking on the two arrow keys
Most of these tracks are blocked if you see a red light in the distance you cannot proceed in that direction
For instance from the starting point the only direction open is to go north
Be forewarned if you save your game before you complete the maze the game will place you back in the Selenitic Age Spaceship when you return to the game and you'll have to start the maze over again
I would also be careful about using the BACKTRACK button it takes your car back to the last place you left I found it an extremely efficient way of becoming disoriented very quickly
There are three methods for getting through the maze i Map the whole thing This isn't really that hard since you always know which direction you are facing but it certainly takes some time
If you do map watch out for some of the twisty paths that curve around to have you facing a different direction that the one you left on
ii Use the sounds to guide you
As you come to a stop at each location listen for a sound this sound is your guide as to which direction to select next if you miss the sound hit the red button on the left to replay it
A quot Ting quot sounds indicates go north a quot Clong quot sound like a cowbell indicates south a quot Prrrrrrip quot sound means to go west and a quot Foish quot sound means to go east
The sounds are combined for the other four directions for example southwest would be represented by a quot Clong quot and a quot Prrrrrrip quot sound together
Be forewarned though I found it difficult to make out some of the sounds at certain locations and if you wander off the correct path sometimes the sounds send you down dead ends the dead ends are easy to spot since they don't have any sounds associated with them
iii Just follow this handy guide to find the end of the maze
N W N E E S S W SW W NW NE N SE
Once the car stops at the end of the maze get out of the chair and press the blue button on the wall to open the door
Proceed straight ahead until you enter a chamber you should see a Myst linking book straight ahead
Click on it and it takes you back to Myst Back in the library go over to the red book and add the red page by clicking on the book
Now open the book and listen to Sirrus again he's happy to see you were successful but he wants more pages so that he can get out of his book prison
But do we trust him
We'd better hedge our bets and go back to the Selenitic Age for Agenar's blue page
Proceed back to the Spaceship and repeat all of your actions to bring the blue page back to Myst Island remember the blue page is by the dripping water basin
Don't worry the underground train car will have magically returned to its starting point for another trip through the maze
Once you are back in the library add the blue page to the blue book and listen to Agenar rave on about imprisonment his untrustworthy brother and the blue pages
Stoneship Age Getting a Date The Stoneship Age is accessed via the dock area
On the island map in the library revolve the Tower by clicking and holding the tower symbol so that the rotation line lies above the location of the dock the line should turn red when it is in the right position
Open the Tower passageway by clicking on the picture of the staircase
Proceed down the passageway to the elevator and go up to the tower level
Go up the ladder immediately ahead of you for a view of the sunken ship by the dock
Go back down around the tower and up the opposite ladder
You will see a plaque on the wall that reads OCTOBER AM JANUARY AM NOVEMBER PM
Go back down the ladder into the elevator press the button to go back down to the Library level and back out the passageway to the library room
Click on the doorway picture to open up the outside door and go outside
This Isn't quot Laser Floyd quot Proceed into the round building containing the dentist's chair
Once inside turn around to face the door and hit the button to the right of the doorway to turn off the lights
Hey look at the stars on the ceiling It's a planetarium
Turn around and click on the close up of the chair to sit down
Click anywhere on the black panel suspended above your head to bring it into your main view
Use the up down arrow buttons to input each of the dates into the display and hit the centrally located flashing button after each one
A constellation map will appear on the left side of the panel be sure that you carefully copy down the locations of the stars for each of the three dates
Once finished lift the panel by clicking beside it and go back to the library
Go to the bookcase you may remember that the Stoneship Age journal vertical grey spine near the right side of the top shelf has a series of symbols and constellation maps in the back
Look through the pages of symbols and match up the three constellations with the ones you copied down from the planetarium the three matching symbols should be the Beetle the Snake and the Leaf
Salvage Operation Now where were those symbols
Of course on the raised boxes that surround the central basin
If you are standing outside the library looking at the basin the Leaf symbol is located on the third box to the left and the Snake and Beetle symbols are on the second and third boxes on the right respectively
Approach each of the three boxes and click on the symbol each one should turn green
Once all three are activated you should hear the roar of gushing water
Have a look at the basin the model ship has now been raised out of the water
Go down to the dock to see that the submerged ship off the dock has been raised as well
Go ahead and climb aboard the now floating vessel not much to see but an interesting looking door leads to hellip another linking book
Click on the book twice watch the Stoneship Age flyover and click to enter the age
The Boat that Wouldn't Float You arrive in the Stoneship Age on the aft of Atrus' ill fated ship
From the aft you can access a semi submerged lighthouse note the locked attic inside and the immovable key on the ground here via a set of planks a umbrella covered contraption via another set of planks and the fore section of the ship which is reached by a set of stone steps
A doorway leading directly into the rock appears to be filled with water as is the access into the ship's interior
From the fore section another submerged doorway into the rock is present as well as a staircase up to the top of the island complete with telescope at the very top
Go to the contraption and note the three knobs
Press the left knob and listen as some sort of pump begins to work
What has happened
Go back to the aft of the ship you can now access the interior of the ship down a stairway opposite the doorway into the rock
Take a peek inside everything is dark we'll have to turn on the lights somehow
Back at the contraption hit the second knob and go back to the ship
The water is back in the ship access stairway but the two doorways into the rock are now dry we'll need to get the lights on in here as well before proceeding
Now try the last knob and go to the lighthouse
We can now access a staircase within the interior of the lighthouse
Go down the stairs and note the locked trunk
In order to float the trunk up to where that key is click on the drain valve on the trunk's left side to empty the water be sure to close the valve once the trunk has drained to trap the air inside
Now go turn the pump off hit the right knob on the contraption so the light goes out and come back to the lighthouse
The trunk should be waiting for you
Click on the key to unlock the trunk pick up another key you find inside and take it up the ladder to unlock the attic door
Inside the attic you will find a hand crank generator and a battery the light supply for the interior of the rock
Click and hold the mouse on the hand crank for a while until the red light on the battery strength gauge turns green about complete turns should do it
Go back to the contraption once more press the middle knob to drain the island go back to the doorway into the rock the one off the aft of the ship
O' Brother Where Art Thou
Go down the staircase until you reach a door and click to enter
This is Sirrus' bedroom pretty nice digs
Have a look at the two orbs on either side of his bed they light up when the cursor touches the glass
Have a look at his desk to the right click on the small silver ball on a pedestal on the desk surface and watch it dance
Open up his desk drawer drugs pills a syringe and a knife maybe Sirrus isn't as well adjusted as we thought
Cross the room and look in each of his dresser drawers coins jewels dishes some cloth and ared pagein the bottom drawer
Pick it up and go back to the surface
It might be prudent to go and crank up the battery again before heading down the other staircase into the rock the one off of the fore section of the ship
Go down to the bottom of the second staircase and proceed into Achenar's bachelor pad
He has quite the skeleton light fixture here
Note that ablue pageis present on his bed to the left we'll come back for this later
Walk across the room and look at his decorative masks nice and the imager on the top of his map case hit the button to see a rose but slide the bottom lever to the right to see the creepy skull
Open each of the map drawers the second from the bottom contains a note that you will want to copy down looks like we've got half of a message that will probably be important
Go back up the staircase and onto the ship
Light of My Life Now how do we turn on the light for the interior of the ship
Go down the stairs towards Sirrus' room
Do you see the three black archways you pass through as you go down the stairs
Stop just before going through the third one and click near the base of the black wall within the archway on the left side this may take some time to find the right spot
A small doorway will open up
Follow the crawlspace to a large painted compass located here
There are buttons spaced out along the degree circle
You must figure out which of the buttons will power the light for the interior of the ship
Hit the wrong button and the lights inside the crawlspace and staircases go out if this happens you'll have to make your way back up to the surface in the dark and re power the battery
To find the proper button go up to the top of the island and peer into the telescope
Using a dragging action with the mouse turn the view screen until you see something that could provide light
At degrees you should see the top of the light source sketched in Atrus' journal back on Myst Island
But which button does degrees correspond to on the compass
Well buttons spaced out over degrees means that each button represents degrees buttons degrees per button
So in order to get to degrees we have to move degrees degrees per button buttons
Go back to the compass and starting from the top button marked by the little arrow at the top of the compass count off buttons as you turn clockwise and hit the twelfth one
A light ahead of you should come on
Go back up to the surface back to the contraption once more to hit the left knob and go down the ship staircase to enter the hold
Go to the bottom of the stairs and click on the table in the centre of the room a linking book will rise out of the surface
Two clicks and you are back to Myst Island
Back in the library go over to the red book and add the red page by clicking on the book
Now open the book and listen to Sirrus again his message is becoming much clearer now
Proceed back to the ship at the dock and link back to the Stoneship Age for the blue page
Once you've got the blue page you will have to find the secret crawlspace to the compass again the game closed up that trap door when you left the first time and turn on the lights before linking back to Myst Island
Once you are back in the library add the blue page to the blue book and listen to Agenar's ravings
Mechanical Age Screw's Clues The Mechanical Age is accessed via the lookout
On the island map in the library revolve the Tower so that the rotation line lies above the location of the lookout the line should turn red when it is in the right position
Open the Tower passageway by clicking on the picture of the wood staircase
Proceed down the passageway to the elevator and go up to the tower level
Proceed up the ladder immediately ahead of you for a view of the lookout
Go back down around the tower and up the opposite ladder
You will see a plaque on the wall that reads
Go back down the ladder take the elevator back down to the Library level and go out the passageway to the library room
Click on the doorway picture to open up the outside door again and go back outside
Telling Time The time you say
Let's have a look at that waterlogged clock
Go down past the basin to the wheel valves that are by the water's edge in front of the clock
The big wheel valve on the left controls the minute's hand one click moves it ahead minutes
The other smaller wheel valve to the right controls the hour's hand one click moves the clock ahead one hour
If you've left the clock alone up to now it should still read o'clock in which case clicks on the big wheel and clicks on the small wheel will get the clock to
If you've played with it and it doesn't read o'clock I'm going to assume you'll be able to get it to
Once at hit the red button and watch the stepping stone gears come out of the water to provide a route to the clock
Playing the Slots Once you're there don't forget to turn on that last signal marker
Click on the door and go in
Remember that three number code from the tower
In order to proceed you want to have the three numbers displayed on the wall that are now reading to show from top to bottom
There are pull down levers on either side of the mechanism
The left lever when pulled this is done by clicking on the lever and pulling it down with the mouse spins the bottom two numbers one turn ahead unless you keep holding the lever down in which case the middle number keeps spinning
The right lever when pulled spins the top two numbers ahead one number and like the other lever if you keep holding it down the middle number keeps spinning
You also have a limited number of pulls before the metal weight located to the far left of the mechanism lands on the ground and you run out of leverage
A pull of the lever to the far right of the mechanism brings the weight back to the ceiling and returns the numbers to
The quickest way to solve the puzzle is to pull the left lever first only holding it down so that the middle and bottom numbers only advance one number the sequence should show at this point
Then do the same with the right lever only advancing the top and middle numbers by one the sequence should now read
Finally pull the right lever again and this time let the middle number spin around again so it read
The sequence should now read and a grinding noise indicates something is happening somewhere else on the island
Don't worry if you mess this puzzle up keep trying and resetting the mechanism until you get it right
Go to the lookout the big gear has spun open to reveal a linking book to the Mechanical Age
Click on the book twice watch the Mechanical Age flyover and enter
Fortress of Solitude You've arrived on Atrus' mechanical fortress
Note the control panel immediately to your right which is unlocked by inputting a series of symbols better save it for later
Go across the walkway and enter the front door of the fortress
Go down the left hallway and turn the corner to go into Sirrus' fun room
There's lots to look at in here his blurry telescope clock models of the Spaceship and the sailing ship a few paintings a mechanical bird that chirps when you wind him up a chess board and Sirrus' throne you can even sit down and survey your kingdom
Try clicking on the wall immediately to the right of the throne near the floor just left of the bottom corner of the wall hanging
A secret door will open
Go in and check out his hoard of treasure
A letter from his brother can be found in the wine rack on the right it's the rolled up parchment they don't appear to have been very civil to each other
Click on the treasure chest in the back corner you'll find ared page
Grab it and go back out
Continue along the hallway you will pass a red button on the wall and a short passage that ends at a large glass cylinder
Ignore this for a moment and keep going along the hallway until you reach Agenar's playroom
He's got a lot of weapons in here his own throne and a nasty surprise in the wind up box try it and see
Click on the imaging equipment located to the left of the throne and a schematic of the island comes up
Note how the controls work here
The left knob when pushed up unlocks the controls to spin the fortress while the right knob controls how far the fortress spins
Get a feel for how long it takes for the fortress to turn one quarter of the way around
Click on the metal door with the horizontal line on it that is located between the imager and the throne and go inside to see what Agenar likes to do with his spare time
Looks like he may fancy himself an amateur surgeon
Check out his skull in a box the chopping block his poisons and his holding cell complete with shocker
Don't miss theblue pagesitting below his potions you'll come back for it later
Spinning Your Wheels Back in the hallway connecting the brothers' rooms click on the red button to activate a staircase downstairs
Go down and approach the small set of controls here
With the mouse push the lever on the right upward and watch the small circle located inside a larger circle rotate around
Stop the rotation when the two circles are aligned with the open ends both pointing downward the circles will also turn red when this happens
Go back up the stairs and hit the button
The staircase will disappear allowing you to access an elevator straight ahead
Inside the elevator click on the centre button and see what happens the elevator stops between floors halfway up the shaft
Now hit the up button to go to the top level
Once the door to the elevator opens hit the centre button again and immediately leave the elevator
The elevator will close and lower to reveal the controls to rotate the fortress
Remember the image first push the left knob up to unlock the mechanism and then push the right knob up to rotate the fortress
Holding the right knob up for a good two seconds should rotate the fortress a quarter turn
Once completed hit the small button below the knobs this will call the elevator back up and go back downstairs
Go out the front door and across the walkway to a small island where two of the four symbols are located on a pedestal copy these down
Go back inside and rotate the fortress another quarter turn to access another small island the same way and the remaining two symbols
Make sure to peer into the telescope in Sirrus' room while the fortress has rotated half a turn from its starting point you will see more evidence of what the lads were up to in this age
Once you've collected all of the symbols rotate the fortress back to its original position and proceed across the walkway to the symbol control panel
The symbols to be inputted in order are a horseshoe two thin triangles surrounding a thin rectangle two triangles below a small circle and a half circle
Do so and press the red button a staircase will appear to the right
Go down the stairs to the Myst linking book waiting below and go home
Back in the library give Sirrus the red page and listen to him again does he sound trustworthy to you
After go back up to the lookout link back to the Mechanical Age collect the blue page from Achenar's evil lab and go beck to Myst to give him the page
Both of these guys appear to be equally untrustworthy
Channelwood Age Clue Combination The Channelwood Age is accessed via the big Tree behind the wooden building
Revolve the Tower so that the rotation line lies above the location of the Tree on the island Map the Tree symbol is a sided shape in the bottom left corner of the map the line should turn red when it is in the right position
Open the Tower passageway by clicking on the picture of the wood staircase
Proceed down the passageway to the elevator and go up to the tower level
Proceed up the ladder immediately ahead of you for a view of the tall tree
Go back down around the tower and up the opposite ladder
You will see a plaque on the wall that reads
Go back down the ladder back into the elevator press the button to go back down to the Library level and back out the passageway to the library room
Click on the doorway picture to open up the outside door again and go back outside
Feed the Flame From the library building go ahead seven steps directly towards the central fountain turn to your left and move to the wooden building
Click on the doorway to open it and go inside
You will see a boiler in front of you a red coloured wheel to its right and a window showing the big tree to the left
Turn around to face the door again and notice the safe immediately to its right
Click on the safe to get a closer view of the three numbered locking mechanism
Can you guess what the combination is
Yes
Hit the three buttons until appears and then click on and drag downward the safe door handle
The safe should open to reveal a box of matches what a treasure
Click on the box to open it click again to get a match and wave the match over the starter strip no clicks necessary on the matchbox to light the match
Take the match over to the boiler and click on the small square box near the bottom left corner of the equipment
A red dot should appear in the box
Now move to the red wheel valve and press and hold the left mouse button down when you find the clockwise cursor symbol on the right hand side of the valve the wheel will turn and a fire will be lit at the base of the boiler
Keep the wheel turning clockwise until the pressure in the boiler begins to build up the needle gauge starts to move to the right and a nasty banging sound starts up
Let it bang about a dozen times before going further
Going Down
The banging is the sound of an elevator that is built into the giant tree
Building the pressure up has caused the elevator car to raise up high above the ground
Now turn the pressure off so that the elevator car will begin travelling downward
Click and hold over the left part of the valve the counter clockwise symbol will be present until you notice the pressure dropping on the boiler the needle gauge starts to move to the left
At this point move back outside turn to your left and click to the right of the wooden building to go to the big tree
You may notice the elevator car dropping quickly if you miss the opportunity to get in just repeat the steps with the red valve back inside the wooden building
Go up right to the tree and wait for the descending car once it's at ground level hop in and enjoy the ride down underground
If you somehow end up in the elevator going up into the treetops use the button immediately to the left of the doorway to quickly lower the car back to ground level just click on the button several times quickly
The elevator takes you down into a secret underground room that contains a book straight ahead your entrance to the Channelwood Age
Click on the book twice watch the Channelwood flyover and click the picture to enter
However if you for whatever reason want to wait to travel to this Age use the red wheel valve to the left of the elevator car to send it back upward rotate the wheel clockwise and then hop in but remember to jump out back at ground level
The Power of Fluid You arrive in the Channelwood Age standing on one of a number of wooden walkways spread out over the water beneath the trees
Take a few moments to acquaint yourself with the surroundings some walkways are dead ends others lead to non functioning pumps and elevators
Notice that there are pipes running along the walkways with valves located where the walkways fork
Make your way towards the windmill located at the beginning of the walkways and climb the rocky hill towards the door
Once inside you will see that the wind power is being used to pump water from below up into a large tank
At the base of the tank you will see a small metal valve click on this vale to get the water running down into the pipes
Now we'll use water power to get some of this machinery working
Go back down the hill onto the walkways to the first fork and click on the valve to get a close up
We want the water flowing to the left here so push the red handle over to the right
Take the left walkway to the second fork we want the water flowing right here so the red handle should be over to the left
Take the right walkway to the third fork and send the water again to the right
Go right once more to the fourth fork and again send the water to the right
Proceed right again and go to the elevator straight ahead you should hear the pump working if you have correctly routed the water here
Click on the elevator to go in click on the door to shut it and pull the red lever to the right of the door to start your trip
Lost in the Branches Open the door onto the quot second floor quot of the Channelwood Age
This is where the monkey people must have lived although the decay and destruction here indicates that they've been gone for a while
Warning its quite easy to get lost on this level since most of the buildings look exactly alike
If you really get stuck go back to the Channelwood Age journal and copy down the map of this portion of the Age
Go straight to the first circular platform and go to the right as you pass through it
Go ahead into a rectangular building monkey house
and turn to your right
Go straight into the next building in front of you and again turn to your right
Go towards another circular platform straight ahead pass through it to the left and go into the next one which happens to be a dead end
However you should see a red handle mounted on a post within this structure
Pull the handle and watch a gate on the far side of the paths open up
Turn around and go back to the previous circular platform go right and then back into the building straight ahead
Turn to your right and go towards the next circular platform
Pass through to the right and go straight into the next building
Keep going straight and go directly into the next building
Turn to your right and approach the gate that has just been opened for you note that there is another elevator here to take you up higher
Go through the open gate down the circular stairway and click on the door to open it
You are back on quot ground quot level
To get that upper elevator working go back to the first walkway fork and redirect the water flow over towards the gate you just emerged from flow to the right
When you return to the stairs you should hear the pump working now
Go back up the stairs and turn to your left to face the elevator open the door go inside close the door and pull the handle to go up
In the Treetops Step out onto the top level and go straight forward then off to the right until you come to a wood building
Click on the door to the left and enter the room for a surprise message from Achenar
Go over and check out his quot table quot try clicking on it ouch got your bum
Go out the door behind the table down the hall and back out onto the wood path
Straight ahead you will find Achenar's room which is quite stark in terms of furnishings
Grab theblue page and take a look at his image recorder being sure to press each of the buttons
Was he trying to boss around the monkey people
Be sure to press the far right button and listen to Sirrus as he mocks his brother
His last statement about the pages seems to suggest they may have been working together
Backtrack along the path past the first building and go to the right when you get to the elevator you'll soon come to Sirrus' room a big improvement as usual
Seems like he's been into the booze a bit though
Thered pagecan be found in a table drawer under the window that has a view of the windmill
Be sure to check the two drawers along the base of the bed one contains a knife while the other contains the other half of thenotethat we found in the Stoneship Age
Be sure to copy it down and compare it with the other fragment to learn about the Myst signal marker vault
Once you've looked around go back to the elevator go down one level the down the staircase to ground level
Now its time to harness the water power again
At the first walkway fork send the water flowing to the left
Go left to the next fork and send the water to the left again
Again go left to the next fork
Send the water to the right and go to the right
Keep going straight ahead until you get to a pump sitting alone at the end of a walkway the pump should be running confirming you've routed the water the right way
Pull the red handle on the pump and a set of steps will rise out of the water connecting you to another section of the walkway
Go straight until you approach another elevator but go right when you see a path branching off
Go straight until you reach a dead end
Here the water pipe is not connected over the gap
Click the gear handle located here and the pipe will telescope across the gap connecting the two pieces
Now go back to re route the water to this new elevator
From the first fork way back near the windmill set the water to go left
At the second branch send the water right
At the third branch set the water right again and at the fourth branch send the water left
Proceed back around to the new elevator once more the pump by the new elevator will be working if you've routed the water correctly go in close the door and pull the handle to go up
Once the door opens again a Myst linking book is in plain view straight ahead
Link back to Myst and add the blue page to the book
Listen as Achenar accuses his brother of greed and murder
Apparently Sirrus murdered Atrus who as he died imprisoned both his sons in the books
Achenar tells us to copy down Pattern from the codebook far right book on the middle shelf of the bookcase and input it into a panel within the fireplace to get the last blue page
He tells us not to touch the red page also located there or the green book that will trap us for all eternity
Now go back to the Channelwood Age to pick up Sirrus' red page
Remember to raise and lower the tree elevator on Myst by turning the red handle in the wooden building
Once you've got the red page link back to Myst again and give Sirrus his red page
We get a detailed description of how Achenar went mad and burned all of Atrus' books
He implores us to give him the final red page by inputting Pattern from the codebook into the fireplace
Red Blue or Neither
First let's check out the marker switch vault mentioned in the secret note
Since all of the switches are on go down to the dock and switch off the marker switch here
The front of the marker switch opens revealing a piece of paper
Grab it since we cannot look at the page it must belong in another linking book interesting
Go back to the library pull out the codebook and copy down Pattern
Once completed close the book and go inside the fireplace
Press the button to the left of the opening and a grey screen will appear
Reproduce Pattern on the screen and press the button again the entire fireplace rotates around and the screen lifts to uncover the green book and thefinal red and blue pages
Now what to do
We've seen enough evidence on our travels to indicate Sirrus' greed and ego and Achenar's madness
Since we've got a linking page in our hands why not try the green book
Open it up and listen to Atrus who is trapped in another age he calls it D'ni tell the tail of his sons' greed and betrayal
He needs a single page to be able to return to Myst
Since we've got the page go ahead and link to the D'ni Age
Give Atrus the page when he asks for it and watch him link back to Myst
Wait a few moments for him to return and thank you
He gives you the run of Myst and the ages and tells you he may need your help in the future can you say sequel
He's too busy to talk much though
That's it a pretty anti climactic ending
Alternate Endings Since there isn't really any way to die in Myst there are only three alternative endings to the story besides getting completely stuck
giving Sirrus the last red page giving Achenar the last blue page or linking to D'ni without the missing page for Atrus' book
Use a previously saved game to go back and try any or all of these endings
As you may have guessed adding the last red or blue page to the books sends you into that book the monologues that Sirrus and Achenar deliver as they rip out the pages to trap you forever are quite amusing
Almost equally funny was to hear Atrus dressing you down for showing up in D'ni without the last linking book page
GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
Myst Maps by Robert Ellison
Walkthrough by Soren Andersen Patch If you do not have V of this game you will more than likely need a patch available from the Ubisoft web sitefor PC and for MACthat will correct problems encountered in starting game play
Walkthrough Exile is not a linear game and this walkthrough is presented in but one of several possible sequences
For example you may link to the Amateria Edanna or Voltaic Ages in any sequence you choose
Another instance is that the puzzles in Amateria may be attacked in any order
The walkthrough is written with the idea that you may consult it wherever you find you might need assistance
You may read the first few paragraphs of this walkthrough the Preface without anything being given away
Included at the end are a couple pages of screenshots and diagrams these are not spoilers
The screen shots are available in the game and are presented in a bunch for con venience to the player
The diagrams are aids to help keep track of puzzle results as they are solved
Make your own copy and mark them as you play
Preface To start with a word about linking books
These items are basic to the game as well as the two previous games which would have you think the art of writing them was perfected by the D'Ni Atrus' people and from whom he learned the craft
Both he and his wife Catharine are masters of this art
In this game it appears that the D'Ni have previously suffered some sort of devastating setback
By writing these linking books the compelling impression is that a new Age is produced and the book is how one connects with it however at times it seems the Age exists and the book is only the means to get to it
The physical limitations of an Age appears to be indeterminate but experience with the Myst games indicates that they are usually an is land or group of islands set in a vast limitless sea
Once a linking book exists anyone can use it to link to the Age for which it was written
Open one and in the center of the first page is a picture in which are swirling scenes of the Age to which the book links put your hand on the picture and you are off to that place
It is however a one way trip you must have another book to return or to proceed to another Age
You'll see
At the end of the first Myst game Atrus banished his sons Sirrus and Achenar for their misdeeds
Now we learn that he has apparently brought them back with the idea of repatriating them and making them useful members of his family
It would appear that this was a mistake they remain scoundrels
They have inflicted their heinous wrongdoing on an Age called Narayan and Atrus is seemingly unaware of this
A Narayan survivor named Saavedro who may be slightly unhinged by his ordeal is out to wreak revenge
Atrus is an inveterate journal keeper and at the game's beginning he gives you his latest one to bring you up to speed on a new Age he calls Releeshan
You must read this journal with care perhaps more than once so that you get an insight to Atrus' thinking
It reveals in excruciating detail how he has decided to write this new Age in which the D'ni survivors can rebuild their society
As it happens Saavedro also keeps a journal which you may find near the beginning of the game
It too is useful in indicating what he is thinking as well as providing hints of what to do and apparently also some red herrings
Saavedro had been banished to an Age called J'nanin reasons for this none too clear but he found a linking book to Tomahna the place that Atrus had built for his wife and new family and where he Saavedro has made many secret visits to search for Sirrus and Achenar
He has also read many of Atrus' journals and found more linking books
You'll find out all about this in his journal as you keep finding pages for it scattered about
Beginning When the game opens you are just outside Tomahna where you find Catharine with her infant daughter
Catharine welcomes you and gives you a message from Atrus and suggests that you wait for him in his study
When she sits on a bench go through the study door straight ahead
Inside you may look around as long as you wish
The prominent item is the Releeshan linking book which is on locked display
Atrus enters and gives you his journal which goes to inventory
You and he are about to link to Releeshan when Saavedro appears causes a certain amount of destruction grabs the Releeshan linking book and links back out to J'nanin but in so doing he drops his J'nanin linking book open on the floor
Put your hand on the swirling picture and you are off in pursuit
J'nanin Age As you link to J'nanin you get a brief swirling tour that is charac teristic of the linking process
You get a good look at Saavedro's retreat on the top of a rock pillar the round building that is on the User Manual cover
When you are set down on a rock plateau you see Saavedro disappear behind a rock
Follow him to see him go up a ladder in a rock face then across a walkway into his retreat
When you get to it the door is locked and through the window you can see him pacing inside
There is no apparent need for immediate action so from your elevated location take some time to look around
Move back along the walkway and survey the island as you do so as you will be moving all over this Age
You can see that it is a barren rocky place with steep cliffs surrounding a deep central ravine with a small lake or pond at the bottom
There are many steps and ladders up and down the cliffs and bridges connecting them
Prominent among the jagged rocks are smooth unique tusk like pillars there are three and in several places you can see things that are clearly man made
Perhaps you can find another way to get to Saavedro in his retreat
Go down the ladders to the beach and turn right moving along the sand a couple of clicks to where on the right is another ladder up a rock
Go up this ladder for another look around
Down at the bottom of the ravine there is a walkway that goes across the pond to what looks like a building at the base of the rock pillar on which the retreat is built and down the cliff are steps that must lead to it
While you are here examine the apparatus that you find on this rock
On a pedestal is an object that bears a remarkable resemblance to an old time railroad bullseye lantern but instead of one lens there are three of them on it
There is a blue fire marble on its top
By click ing on the ring below the lenses it may be turned so that each lens will face you
Get closeups of these lenses as they turn in order to see what is in its field of view
There are other positions around this lantern where you may stand and what you see in the lens may be dif ferent as you occupy these positions
You can see more of these lanterns in the distance
Return to the beach turn right and follow the sand path to its end where you can observe a couple more objects in the near distance
Go up the sloping rock on your right to find another lantern this one with a yellow fire marble on its top but otherwise identical to the one you just examined even to the squeaks as it is turned
Keep going past this lantern past a post that looks as though something had been af fixed to the top of it and onward until you get near the base of one of the tusks
You might want to dash up to see what's there
Follow the steps ever downward through a stone arch where there is a noisy wind and to the walkway across the water to the building that you saw at the base of the retreat pillar
Cross the walkway to this colorful cottage where the door is not locked
Enter and find controls that will open a couple gates so you can get to the room inside
The first thing to do is go to the hammock on the right and get Saavedro's journal and read it
Interesting and informative
Then go around the bench and examine the items on it
There is a generator that produces electrical discharges that suspend some scraps when you turn its crank and if you move the plant root and again turn the crank the Venus flytrap opens for a bit
There is an analogy here for other Ages
There is a balance that indicates that four crystal balls equal the weight of one sphere that appears to be metal
To the left is another balance showing that four wooden balls are equal to the weight of one crystal ball
All the balls are of the same size
Another bit of information for the Amateria Age
The main item of interest is the brown cylindrical elevator
Go around to the right of it open the door and enter
There is an aperture in the wall through which you can reach the switches that send the elev ator up
It rotates a little and through a viewing window you can see into Saavedro's retreat
Saavedro appears shortly carrying a linking book
He makes a couple remarks then puts the book on a platter and taps it with the mallet he always carries
The bottom part of the platter takes the book down out of sight and a latticework football shaped cage appears from below
Saavedro leaves and comes wandering back with another book but there is nothing more for you here
You can open the elevator door but not the outer one beyond it through which you can see the part of the island with the yellow fireball lantern
Push the green wall button to send the elevator down
Go out of it and from outside the elevator send it back up then step into the well below it
Down here you can see where four panels have been broken and behind them is machinery
Presumably this was done by Saavedro to prevent access from the elevator to the room above as just demonstrated
Look in his journal for some clues
At the end are four drawings that look like the machinery behind the broken panels
Set the three weights as he has drawn them move the upper gear with the mis sing tooth as shown in the sketch and move the lever in the direction of the arrow
The full page drawing shows how to set the cylinders on the ends of the arms in the last piece of machinery
Step back out of the well call the elevator step in and go up again
Now when you reach the top and open the door your view through a different outer door is into the room
The latticework football is open and there is a linking book in it
Saavedro hurriedly puts his hand on it and disappears the football closes and drops down below
You can now open the door and enter the room
Move around until when facing the center of the room you are between a large blue disk on the left and a smaller one on the right
Click on the smaller one
Three hemi spherical wall panels open and a projection of Atrus appears on the ceiling
He begins a message intended for his sons then Saavedro takes over for a tirade directed to Atrus
Atrus planned to have his sons search J'nanin for three linking books but Saavedro has made changes and he says now you must look for three symbols to open this device presumably the latticework football that you can see below
Now it is your task to find the three linking books and then the symbols
Move to one of the wall projectors and get a closeup
Around the edge of the center lens are inscribed tic marks at the eight cardinal and ordinal compass positions
On the lens is etched an icon
You must drag on this lens moving the field of view until you locate a plaque match ing the icon and bring the two together
There are horizontal and vertical wooden handles left and right of the lens the horizontal one zooms the image in and out and the vertical one adjusts the focus
You must exactly match the focused image with the etched one then make a note of the position of the four marbles that have been circling the lens
There is a certain amount of interaction between these controls and the focus one tends to be finicky
You will probably find it easier to locate the plaque if you zoom part way in before trying to locate it
The plaque is on a tusk so it may help to look for a smooth surface
Move to another wall projector a different icon will be etched on the lens
Repeat the same process with the icon on that lens then to the last wall projector to do it again
One of the icons is an oval one is a bird and one could be a diving whale or it could be a curled leaf take your choice
When done you should have in your notes a record of each icon and the positions of the four marbles around the lens where the icon appeared
You may have inferred by now that the three linking books you seek are in the three tusks and you must find a way to get into them
These tasks are independent you do not have to follow the order taken in this walkthrough
Linking Book Using the handle to the right of the elevator door call the elevator and ride it down
Go through the cottage room to the anteroom just beyond the entrance turn right to see a couple steps beyond a doorway
Go out the door above the steps cross the bridge to the shore of the pond and turn left where you can see a small teepee a couple of rocks away
When you go to it and click on the top a light gray chipmunk pokes his head out of the entrance but won't come out
The game calls this animal a squee
It wants to feed on the black and rose colored flowers to the right but is afraid to cross the water in between
Help it out click on the plant growing in the water which collapses and spreads
Now when you click on top of the teepee the squee scoots out and goes to the flowers squeaking and chirping
Very strangely with this chirping the bulbous flowers expand
Leave the squee to its meal and go back to the bridge from the cottage
On the rock face ahead is another ladder for you to climb
Part way up is a small sloping meadow of flowers and moss the flowers near the top being the same as those that the squee is eating
Move to this meadow where above you can see the door in a stone tusk but you can't get to it
Turn toward the chasm between two small rock pillars you will find a drooping flower with a strange capability it is able to direction ally pick up and amplify sounds
Zoom onto this plant and move it around whereupon you can hear the bridge creaking the whistling rock waves and wind
What you want to hear is the chirping of the squee below
When you locate this sound left click to have your view turn and see the flowers at the top of the meadow expand greatly
Now you can climb the ladder to the top and then cross on the expanded flowers to the door in the tusk
This door is not locked so in you go
Cross to the brown cylinder and get a closeup where you will see four marbles in concentric races
Clearly you must place the marbles in one of the compass settings that you have just determined and since there are only three to try this in no great task
Hint try the bird icon
Move the marbles in their races to the chosen setting press the center button and when you have the correct set the latticework football descends to display a linking book in it
The book is titled EDANNA and has the bird symbol on it so you now have the name of an Age and an icon for it
Click on the book to open it then on the square swirling picture and you will have linked to the Edanna Age
Edanna Age The first impression of Edanna as you circle around it is that it is a very large very tall rock pillar alone in the ocean
Soon however it seems more likely that it is wood rather than rock perhaps the remains of a huge tree
Immediately upon setting down you see a large red flower and a cage of tangled roots
There is something in the cage but you can't make it out
Turn to the flower this is your introduction to an Edanna phenomenon that you will encounter frequently here a lens flower
Zoom in on the lens in the flower center and you will see more clearly into the cage
In it is a book and from the barely discernible three tusk icon on the cover it is a J'nanin linking book
There is a long passage that will take you to the bottom of a plant whose leaves actually just one continuous leaf form a spiral around the stalk
Step on the leaf and it begins to undulate taking you upward to a level near its top
Pan to the top of the plant then down
You will be following a curled stem that ends in a suction cup in a light blue basin of clear water
This is how the plant gets its moisture rather than through roots
Look up and right to another red lens flower
Click on it and a bird comes circling in from over the water and lands on its nest
Step closer for a better look an even better look is had through the lens flower
The bird is feeding the one chick that has hatched
Below the nest is another cage of roots with something in it that cannot be made out
Go out through the more or less circular hole in the rock or wood wall on the right and start up the yellow path
You will see another spiral leaf plant this one with its leaf dried and held close to the stem the fronds at the top withered
A couple steps more and you can see that its water source is dry
There is a plump moisture filled melon or gourd hanging over the dry basin
Continue along the yellow path and around the cliff on a ledge to an area of vegetation
Somewhere in all this the bird appears flying away
Here there is another lens flower
It resembles a sunflower and it has a red berry in the center
Click on the berry and the flower unfolds to expose the center lens somewhat different than the previous ones
Zoom in on the lens and you can pan around to see the spiral leaf plant and its dry basin
Zoom out and glance at the lens flower to see that it is in the shade
Now turn right where there is a plant with long stalks on the ends of which are leaves like a palm tree
Click on the center of this plant and the stalks straighten and the leaves close
In so doing another J'nanin linking book is revealed
Return to the lens flower on which the sun is now shining
Zoom in on the flower center where the lens acts as a burning glass a burned spot on a root attest ing to its heat
Train the bright spot on the moisture filled melon and in a very short time it bursts and fills the dry basin
You can see the plant suck up the liquid and the spiral leaf reforms
Return down the path to a point where you can step onto the newly revived leaf and you will get a long ride down to the Edanna lowest level
Some areas are pretty dark here illumination mostly from the yellow bugs clinging to surfaces but there are places where beams of sunlight penetrate
It is easy to get lost but most of the time if you get on a wrong track you will circle back to a point you will soon recognize
Head now toward leaves that you can see a short distance away then turn left to see a pink squid swimming in a small pool
Step toward it and you may note that it is luminescent as the pink light travels with it and along with that there are electrical discharges when it stops to feed on the roots that dangle into the water
That kind of squid
Go to the left of the squid down a rock path to a lavender valley
Keep going four clicks through the valley and to the right you will see sunlight shining on a brown speckled insect which when you get close to it turns out instead to be another thirsty melon
Click on the small yellow cap between the tentacles and the melon begins to fill with water in pulses through the vine behind it and finally brings along the squid apparently none the worse for the transfer down the vine
Turn right to see a yellow patch go to it and you will find more pages of Saavedro's journal
After you have read them go directly to the yellow patch and through the opening on the right
Step down on a shiny tan root and turn right to see a log of questionable sturdiness
This log bridges a gap and has growing on it the black and rose colored flowers that expand when a squee chirps the ones used to get to the Edanna tusk door on J'nanin
Cross the log hearing as you do so some sort of commotion
Follow the pink root a couple clicks to where you see a round blue patch
Go up to the patch and click on the V shaped notch in it
Turn slightly right and click on the left edge of the small irregular patch of sunlight and through an opening you will see a hanging brown gourd lantern
Go to the lantern
Pull on the vine dangling from it
The petals shading the light open up and things get bright whereupon a large rolled up leaf shudders and then unrolls
Walk down this leaf and you are facing that decrepit log bridge with the expanding squee flowers growing on it
Can't get to it though
Turn around and you will see a ledge on which is a small hemi sphere with a rope affixed to the top
Can't get over there either
Look up and you will see a blue vine with an end that looks like a coat hanger
Click on it and it extends downward
Now when you put your cursor on the ledge it turns the into coat hanger vine shape left click and you swing over there
On the far side of the clearing is the first non organic thing you have seen on Edanna
The rope from the hemisphere runs to it and when you click on the crank the hemisphere rises
It is a squee trap
Why would Saavedro want to trap a squee
Shake the plant with the pink nuts on it
One falls and rolls under the trap
Click on it to roll it farther you don't want to trap the squee you just want to frighten it
Go into the recess behind the tiny winch for some reason you stumble
Get up and you find that you are again by the round blue patch with the V shaped notch in it
Follow the path that you took before back to the lantern
Start down the unrolled leaf and a very short cut scene shows a squee coming out of the shrubbery and getting the pink nut
Pull on the stirrup shaped handle on the bank the trap falls next to the squee who runs across the old log bridge stopping to chirp while on it
The flowers expand breaking the bridge and it falls below
The squee escapes
Click again on the blue vine overhead and this time use it to swing through the gap left by the fallen log bridge
Turn left to find another of the brown gourd lanterns
Turn it on just because you can
Another of the big curled leaves unrolls but don't bother to go down it because it leads to a dead end
Instead head for the hole in the pink wall
Turn left and go five clicks toward some plants in the distance
On the left is a giant Venus flytrap and when you get close to it you find that it has captured the mother bird
That must have been what you heard as you crossed the log bridge
Probably went in looking for insects
You must free the bird so that she can care for her chick and eggs but also you will need her help later
Turn right and proceed to that triangular bit of the ocean in the distance
When you get there turn left and move one click and you will find a brown path
Follow this curvy path four more clicks then look back and you will see a painting of Atrus' sons done by Saavedro
At the foot of it next to Saavedro's paints is another of those thirsty melons click on it and it is soon filled with water and the lumin escent pink squid
Turn around look up
Above the tangle of thorny roots you can see the Venus flytrap
Move forward once
The tangle of roots are those of the flytrap
You can faintly hear the sound of the struggling bird above
Go down the path to the left of the roots passing around a large basin full of plants and starting upward again
Watch very closely on the right for one more of those thirsty melons and when you find it bring down the water and squid
Continue along the path past the melon until you are stopped
Turn right and jump down on a root that is at right angles to the one you are on
Move one step and look to the right for a pair of short vertical white marks
Click on these and you will be at a viewer where you can get another message from Saavedro
Get back on the root path and follow it right until it ends where on a vertical surface there is a bit of sunlight shaped like a two tined fork
The tines point left at another rolled up leaf but here there is no gourd lantern that will provide bright light to make it unroll so you will have to find another way
Go back up the path and where you jumped down jump up
Continue back up the path past the Venus flytrap roots then turn around and go down the path to the right of these roots
Soon you will see on the right a white orchid and on the left another one a little smaller
A couple of clicks farther you will dis cover when you go to it that it is one of the many lens flowers
Click on the center to look through the lens and you can move the view to see the rolled up leaf
Now it seems to have some faint light on it that wasn't there when you were this is probably so that you can locate it when looking through the lens flower
Get back on the path and go farther downward until stopped
Here you will see intense light reflected up from down below and falling on another purple orchid at the left one more lens flower
Click on the lens and you will see the squid in the melon and to the left two orchids one on each side of a limb
Train the bright spot on the left orchid
Now go back up the path and you will find that the first lens orchid is brightly lit and has a bright spot when you click on its lens
Place the spot on the rolled up leaf whereupon it unrolls
Return again up the path to the flytrap roots and down the left hand path to the now unrolled leaf
Cross on the leaf then go up the long clicks steep path of mushrooms where you will find one of the sunflower lens flowers such as the one you encountered when reviving the wilted plant with the spiral leaves
Look through it and you will see that it is focused on the swimming squid
Go past it up to another purple lens orchid
Click on the lens then pan around until the sun flower below is in the center of the field of view
Back off and return down the path past the sunflower and into a shallow cave
Pan left a little and go toward the patch of sea get close to it then click just above the glowing mushrooms
Three clicks and you are back to the unrolled leaf
Go up the familiar path to the flytrap roots then down the right hand path to the end where the light from below is falling on the purple lens orchid
Click on the orchid lens and move the bright spot from the orchid on the left of the branch to the one on the right
A video shows the light going to the melon holding the squid causing it to burst and release the squid and water into the basin below
The electrical discharges from the squid to the flytrap roots causes it to open and release the bird which flies away
You have pretty well covered the area around here but there are some places above the unrolled leaf to be explored
Click on the lens orchid again and move the bright spot back to the orchid on the left of the branch so the leaf will unroll again and once more take the paths to it
Go up the mushroom path three clicks and pan far right to an open ing with a horizontal hollow log dividing the views of sky and sea
There is an indiscernible opening into this log in the dark area just to the right of the opening to the sky and sea
Click there and turn left
Go ahead around the corner then look to the right for more pages from Saavedro's journal
Turn around and advance all the way to the opening to the sea
Just to the right of the opening is a brown cone that looks like a wasp's nest with a blue vine hanging from it and on the end of the vine is another coat hangar such as the one that you used before
When the cursor changes to the coat hangar click the mouse button and you will swing to a new area
You will see stairs that lead indirectly back to the coat hangar vine and to the area that you just left in case you need to go back there but for now go down the path just to the left of the stairs and turn left into the dark swamp
You will immediately notice a large blue sphere on the water it has leaves around it so it must be some sort of plant
Advance down the path observing this plant as you go
You will see two small curved stems on the top
Also keep an eye out for an area of small white flowers on the left
At the end of this long path you will find another spotted purple lens orchid in a patch of light
Click on the lens and move the bright spot to the stems on the top of the sphere they will rise
Return down the path to the small white flowers now on the right
Go two clicks over the flowers and you are on path that will take you either left or right
Turn around to see what the exit to the main path looks like just in case you need it
Take the path to the left a few steps while looking at the plant on the right
It is another of the spheres but it has opened because of the sunlight in which it is sit ting
There is a cloud of insects flying around the stems
For reasons known only to this game these insects must be made to move over to the other plant
Return along the path continuing past the place where you entered
You will eventually find in the path another of those plants with the long stems and palm leaves
This one has the leaves closed click on the orange bump at the base and they open shading the open blue plant with the insect cloud
You can hear it closing
Go back along the path and you will see that it has indeed closed but the insect are still there
Keep going until stopped by a hollow blue root
This must be the runner from which these blue plants grow
You can go over to the big blue plant to examine the brown ones click on the largest of these and it emits a cloud of spores that drive the insects away
If the plant is not closed the insects will not leave
Go back to the hole in the blue root
Just for the fun of it click on the brown spore plant next to the root and watch the sneeze
Enter the root and go left
Travel the length of the root to the first blue plant picking up more pages of Saavedro's journal on the way
The passageway ends at pedestal on which there is a black entity that looks rather like a cat
Click on the pedestal then go up as far as you can
There are the insects flying around the flowers you raised with the orchid
Pan right past an opening showing sky and leaves to a bifur cated stem or root
Click on this root for an upward view then follow it down until the hand cursor appears
Click
The plant contracts and sends out spores and strange indeed for a plant it makes a pretty loud bellow
Very shortly the bird appears and grabs enough of the plant that you are in it and carries it back to her nest
She flies around then lands and starts croaking
Look a little to the left to see a spiral plant then down a little and click
Much commotion ending with a convoluted ribbon on a rock
This is Saavedro's symbol for this Age
It is copied to a sheet that goes to inventory
Look up and to the left to see a J'nanin linking book use it to go there
J'nanin Age Back in the room in Saavedro's retreat move around the room until you are between the two blue disks looking down at the latticework foot ball
Put the newly acquired symbol on the larger disk to the left where a copy is made on a screen below and the original returns to inventory
The latticework football rises but does not open
A holo graphic Saavedro appears in the ceiling with a message for Atrus telling him what Sirrus and Achenar did to Narayan how they deceived the people took what they wanted and left Narayan to die
He tell Atrus to keep looking for symbols
Linking Book If the elevator is at the top of the shaft use the handle to the right of the elevator door to send it down then open the door and go over to the outer door
Where did that floor in the elevator shaft come from
Unbolt the door to the walkway go down the ladder and over to the nearby tusk next to the sea
Note the icon that you can see on the tusk
There is no door here to enter the tusk but not far away is opening in the rock with a ladder leading down
Go down the ladder and you are in a cave with a large opening to the sea
At the end of a walkway on which you are standing is a door that should get you into the tusk but you can't get to it because there is a large ornate barrel blocking the way
In the cave opening there is a pillar and a barely discernible ladder on the rock beside it
Climb out of the cave and go over to this ladder
When you climb down you will find the pillar has on it two levers that will raise and lower sections of the walkway and cause the barrel to roll back and forth
Play with them to see how the barrel moves and shortly you will be able to move it out of the way to the right end of the walkway so that with the ladder vertical you can climb down and get to the door which is not locked
When you open the door you will see across a room the brown pillar with the marbles on it but you can't get to it because Saavedro has broken out most of the floor
He has left a barrel sized hole
Return to the walkway control pillar at the cave opening and with the door left open you can manipulate the levers so that the barrel rolls into the room and fills the hole in the floor
Now you can get to the brown pillar and from the plaque icon outside you know which marble position set to use to bring down the latticework
In this one is the linking book for the Amateria Age
Open the book click on the picture and off you go
Amateria Age During the linking process and when it sets you down you may well get the impression that this Age is an amusement park of sorts and con structed with an oriental motif
As usual it is surrounded by an ocean and many of the structures are built on pilings in the water
Your opening view is from a platform looking at a walkway but first look around
A storm is brewing though you can ignore it as it is just show and never gets closer
To your left out in the water is some construc tion on pilings that you should note for future reference
One of the pilings is red and extends beyond the roof
Turning left again step forward to see a ladder going down to a rickety wooden walkway at the water's surface
On the fourth side of your appearance platform there appears a large round building with a cupola this is the central building of the complex
You can walk a step toward it and see on the left a hexagonal box in which are thirteen smaller hexagons that may be individually tilted clearly this is a puzzle for when you get more information
Toward the central building you can see two more of these boxes
As you will see there are elevated tracks all over this Age
Three of the four puzzles involve guiding an iceball dropped from the central building cupola honest
to go around the tracks through each puzzle and back into the building
The three puzzles may be pursued in any order that you wish but you will be here directed to arguably the easiest one first
Observing on both sides as you go proceed along the walkway to find a J'nanin linking book on the right
Continue ahead still observing to a rocky entrance to a rocky island
Make your way through this serpentine entrance through the rocks and past a series of square pillars topped by fire marble lanterns
When you reach the last lantern you will see to the left an outside exit pathway and on the right past an elevator is a tunnel illuminated by glowing crystals
Go through the tunnel at the end of which is a chamber where there is another of Saavedro's paintings
Go around to the right and out through what looks like the ribs of an old wooden shipwreck
Bearing right you will reach a rough column that takes you up to an iceball track
Sonic Ring Puzzle On the right the track comes from the cupola and across the way you can see it going back into the building
On the left is the puzzle consisting of a series of hairpin track turns carrying the iceball through sonic rings several of which you can see
You must set con trols so that the ring sound is turned off as the iceball comes to it otherwise the sound will shatter the ball
Follow the track through the center of the puzzle and out to the first hairpin loop at the end of which is a sonic ring that you can see and hear
There is also a short pier from which by turning right you can get a closeup of the first control
The control is a dial with irreg ular shaped silver pieces at clock positions and
Place the pointer at the first position
Return to the track where you will be right in the sonic ring but the sound waves will not affect you only the iceball
Continue left along the track through the tunnel and out to the next hairpin
This time you will have to go through the sonic ring to get to the pier and control which must be set to the next position
A diagram will be invaluable to keep track of your progress
Follow the track setting controls to successive indicators at each hairpin
The last control must be set to then go to the puzzle center and back along the entrance track to the column that you climbed to get to the track
Go down the column and through the ship ribs to the other side of the painting chamber
Against the left wall is a ladder that is a narrow ceramic column with handholds carved or molded in it
At the top go along the track as far as you can then turn left and step off to a control panel
At the left is a long handle to pull whereupon you and the panel will rise to where you get a good view of the puzzle and the display will light up
There is another handle just to the left of the display pull this handle and incredibly the cupola rises and drops an iceball onto the entrance track
As the ball moves through the puzzle cogs on the display move a marble over the blue lights turning off the sonic rings as the ball comes to them signified by the darkening of the crystals on poles above the rings
If you have set all five controls correctly the ball sails through the puzzle and back into the central building if you have made a mistake the sonic ring will disintegrate the iceball at that location and you will have to try going around the track and setting the controls again
After the iceball goes into the building panels on each side of the control rise and join and on them will be a brief video of the pilings out in the water as seen from the platform where you were set down
Watch closely as a bridge segment rises from the water in one of the three gaps then sinks again
Note which gap before the video fades
After that happens the panels fold and form a cover on which is a pattern of some of the thirteen hexagons in the hexagonal box next to your landing platform
Note this pattern of course but also note the color of the hexagonal border
Pull the long handle to lower the control platform get back on the track and go down the ceramic ladder
Go through the glowing crystal tunnel until you are back at the elevator get in the elevator and click on the handle to take it up
Metal Chute Puzzle Here you see part of the workings of the metal chute puzzle
There is the chute itself and a large moveable gear that is one of a pair whose axle provides a fulcrum for tilting the chute
There is also an orange balance ball get a closeup of the latter to see that three of the quadrants are wood and one is crystal
Hanging below the end of the chute is a sling and next to it a mallet
Tracks lead to both the sling and the chute
The balance ball is positioned such that an iceball moving on the track above it will send it off on its own track
Return to the elevator and on the other side opening are some pages of Saavedro's journal for you to pick up
Take the elevator down and go past the lantern out on the wooden walkway moving along until you get to a control panel that you can see on your right
When you are facing the control panel pull the long handle on the left and the panel rises
From here you can get another closeup of the balance ball show ing all wood and indicating that it is divided into octants instead of quadrants seven of wood and one crystal
To see how things operate move the handle on the right side of the panel downward
The cupola rises from behind the chute and drops an iceball which shortly passes over the balance ball
The latter is dislodged and moves on its track around to the sling getting there just before the iceball gets to the chute
The weight of the balance ball in the sling tilts the chute
Unless the tilted chute is in exactly the correct position the iceball smashes rather than passing along it and onto the track at the other end
The mallet then sends the balance ball back to its original location
The three horizontally moving handles on the control panel set the position of the fulcrum gear to either end of the chute or in the middle of it as determined by the indication on the blue strip next to them
There is no end to the supply of iceballs so try the gear at all three locations
None work the iceball smashes each time
Use the long handle to lower the control panel and continue along the shore toward the building with the blue roof looking carefully at the chute as you go
You will see that it is fastened to a wooden beam and at the end of the beam a cable passes down through the roof of the house
When you get inside the house it is evident that the cable is part of a counterweight system
Recall that in the cottage below Saavedro's retreat on J'nanin there were balances that showed metal ball balanced crystal balls and crystal ball balanced wooden balls
Assigning a relative weight of unity to wood the balance ball has a weight of
The counterweight as you find it has a weight of
There are other wood crystal and metal octal counterweights lying about that may be added dragged to the already there but what is the value needed
There is no indication of what this might be and you could try placing various combinations of octants to get the right counterweight by trial and error but a good start might be the weight of the balance ball or multiples of that weight
When you achieve the correct combination of counterweight value and fulcrum wheel location the iceball sails through the chute and dis appears behind it presumably back to the central building
Panels on each side of the control then rise and join and on them will be a brief video of the pilings out in the water as seen from the platform where you were set down
Watch closely as a bridge segment rises from the water in one of the three gaps then sinks again
Note which gap before the video fades
After that happens the panels fold and form a cover on which is a pattern of some of the thirteen hexagons in the hexagonal box next to your landing platform
Note this pattern of course but also note the color of the hexagonal border
Lower the control box and go back the way you came all the way to the sonic ring puzzle and up onto the entrance track
Go to the puzzle center then out the exit track
When the supports between the track rails end you can jump off to the left and move along on the stone pillars then continue on the stone path beside the wall on your left
Eventually coming to a gate in the wall
Remember to observe as you go perhaps moving a couple steps beyond the gate and then returning to it
Open the gate to the hardest of the puzzles
Iceball Pinball Puzzle Again there is a long handle on the left of the control console that will raise it to give a view of the puzzle
On each side of a four crossover track array is a set of six revolving iceball sized rings three with bottoms and three without
The iceball comes down from the cupola goes through the first crossover track and lands in a cup in the left set of rings which then starts to rotate
On the control panel are a pair of disks with holes in them at clock positions and and which turn in synchronism with the ring sets
At the bottom of the panel is a well containing three red pegs
You are to place the pegs in the holes in the disks so the iceball moves from side to side ending on the right in a ring with no bottom and that is over the track that takes it back to the central building
The number of iceballs is limitless so you can play with this puzzle all you want in order to see how it performs and probably come up with the solution
To get the cupola to rise and drop an iceball click on the horizontally moving handle on the panel between the disks and the peg well
You may use any number of pegs but if you analyze the ball movement you will see that you need two pegs in the left disk and one in the right
Spoiler amp
After the iceball rolls back to the central building panels on each side of the control will rise and join and on them will be a brief video of the pilings out in the water as seen from the platform where you were set down
Watch closely as a bridge segment rises from the water in one of the three gaps then sinks again
Note which gap before the video fades
After that happens the panels fold and form a cover on which is a pattern of some of the thirteen hexagons in the hexagonal box next to your landing platform
Note this pattern of course but also note the color of the hexagonal border
Use the long handle to bring the control panel down
As you turn to leave pick up more pages of Saavedro's journal to the left of the gate
Outside the gate turn left and continue walking beside the wall then along the rickety water level boardwalk to and up the ladder to your arrival platform
Go to the hexagonal box and try clicking on tiles in the patterns you have found until you have the one that when you back off snaps together the supports between the tracks
Do the same for the other two boxes and you will be able to enter the main building
Keep track of the solution border color progression
Click on the oval door in the building roof and it will swing up so you can enter
When you do that a marvelous stairway swings around and unfolds so you can go up to the cupola where there is a red chair that turns to you when you click on it
Click on the chair again to sit in it and if you wish you may get a video from Saavedro but it is a duplicate
Look up to see a handle pulling on it results in a visual commotion indicating that the cupola has moved up and is suspended
A display board turns over and you are presented with the final puzzle of this Age
Cupola Puzzle This puzzle is pretty easy once you understand the rules
You have of course kept track of which puzzle raised which of the three segments of the offshore bridge to the red pillar structure
Over the top of the puzzle you can see that the iceball track approaches this bridge from the right so you want to raise the segments in right to left order Sonic Ring Metal Chute and Iceball Pinball
From the colors of the associated hexagon puzzle borders that is color sequence blue yellow and green
Around the borders of the puzzle are four colored lines representing the puzzles each line has a hexagon on one end with a triangle pointing into it which means that is the entry and a point on the other end signifying the puzzle exit
In this cupola puzzle you have to rotate the disks so that you have a complete path starting from the blue exit through the yellow and green lines to the red hexagon
Then look up at the roof and click on the blue light to form and drop an iceball
Before you do that however save your game and play around with this puzzle
Click on a disk to break your path and see what happens when you launch an iceball
With a complete path click on a different colored overhead light to see the iceball go through the puzzles
When you are ready to complete this Age have your path continuous and click on the blue light to see some extraordinary programming
When the iceball forms you are in it looking through the transparent shell and not rotating as it goes through the puzzles
When it finally stops on the offshore terminus the ice breaks and you will be looking at one of Saavedro's symbols which is copied and goes to inventory
Look down for the linking book back to J'nanin
J'nanin Age Again you link back to Saavedro's retreat
As before move between the two blue disks then place the just acquired sheet with the symbol on the larger disk
A copy is made to the screen below and the lattice work football opens but you cannot yet get to the book in the center of it
A holographic Saavedro appears above to taunt Atrus again
One more symbol he says
Linking Book Should the elevator be at the top of the shaft send it down
Open the elevator door and cross over and exit the outer door
As you step out you can see the blue and yellow fire marble lanterns
Go down the ladders to the beach and follow the sand path past the blue fire marble lantern and on to the one with the yellow marble
From here you can get to the two objects you just saw as you were coming along the path
One of these is a turnstile that you can turn so naturally that is what you do
On a pillar in the sea below the cliff is a large paneled sphere with a smaller one on its top
When you turn the turnstile the larger sphere rotates
Great
Do it some more
After three turns you can see that a panel on the sphere is missing one more turn brings it around so that sunlight shines into the sphere where the panel is absent and a light beam appears from the top sphere to shine on the device to the left of the turnstile
This device some how amplifies or concentrates the light emitting a beam that is aimed at the lantern with the yellow fire marble
Return to this lantern and now as you rotate it you can see a light beam emerging from one of the lenses
Stand with your back to the light amplifier and look through the lantern rotating it until you see the lantern with the blue fire marble on it
The light beam is now shining on that lantern
Perhaps now these lanterns should be more correctly called reflectors since that is what they do
Now go to the blue marble reflector and repeat the process of standing with your back to the light beam and turning the reflector to see an other one then go to that one and again send the beam to another reflector
There are seven reflectors and as you go to them you must note the color of the fire marbles on them
This is important
There are some repeats of colored marbles
The last of the reflectors is on the rock where you came to rest when you first linked to J'nanin from Tomahna and saw Saavedro run away
It has a red fire marble
In this case what you want to see when looking through it is not another reflector but an instrument that has the shape of the light amplifier on the edge of the cliff
You may have already looked at it
This unit evidently contains a prism because a broad multicolored light beam may be seen to the left of it
Now go to that unit and you will see that the colored beam is shining on a set of five buttons in a door which is in one of the stone tusks
Here is where your notes on the fire marble color series is applied
Push the buttons within the colors in the order of the marble colors as you came upon them
The door opens
Inside the small room there is the familiar brown cylinder that has four marbles in concentric races on its top
There is only one marble pattern left to bring down the latticework container with the linking book
This one is titled VOLTAIC and has the curled leaf icon on it
Click on the book to open it then on the swirling picture and you will have linked to the Voltaic Age
Voltaic Age You arrive in the Voltaic Age on a walkway facing a short stone tower on a very small island next to a very much larger one
Moving ahead and around the tower you find a round portal in it locked of course
There is a sphere in which is a linking book back to J'nanin so you are not stuck here
There is a water channel into the large island
The walkway also leads into the large island with nowhere else to go follow it in passing a tunnel to the right as you go
It takes you to a large cavern open to the sky which you should take time to examine
Part way along the walkway is a circular one to the right this leads to an elevator that does not work because there is no power
Back again on the main walkway go to the end of it passing a very large hemisphere
To the right is boat shaped object that is a hot air balloon an airship
Turn right to a ladder that leads down to another walkway past the back side of the large hemisphere at the end of which is a small platform with a three colored gauge this in front of four wheel valves
Only three of the wheels turn the fourth having been broken by Saavedro
However nothing happens when you turn them
Turn left and step off the platform toward a pathway to the airship but you can't use it because it too has been sabotaged by Saavedro
On the right is another wheel valve that does nothing
There is a ladder however that takes you up near the top of the cavern
Go right to a round grate on which are some pages of Saavedro's journal
Click on them to read them and put them in his book
Next to you is a large hemisphere click on it and it will rotate so that you can go through it to another platform
Ahead is a pipe that leads all the way to the other end of the cavern
It seems to be well supported so walk on it to the other end and step off to the right to a short walkway that will give you a good view from this perspective of the cavern and its contents much of which is support beams and cables for equipment and walkways
Next to you is yet another hemisphere part of a ventilation system
It may be opened by clicking on it
Go through the dark passage keeping an eye out for a grate in the floor
If you miss it and come the end turn around and move one step forward and it will be at your feet
Open the grate and drop down into the lava pit control room
Not much to do here with no power but you can unlock the door
Step out into the junction of two tunnels
It may occur to you that there must be some sort of standby power sufficient to provide illumination where needed
Water Wheel and Power Proceed along the passageway with the blue lights the sound of running water getting louder as you go
On the way there is a short section which is depressed a little and where there is a ladder on the left and a diagram on the right
One step past this on the left is a broken observation window behind which are a series of paddles that will rise if you click on them and fall when you click again
Be sure that you leave them in the fallen position
Continue to the passageway end where there is an area in which is a round portal identical with the one in the stone tower where you entered this Age
To the right you can see this tower beyond the water raceway
Move toward it
There is a shaft with a ladder going down but you can't do this because the shaft is full of water
There is a vertical wooden member on the right with a gear visible on the top
Aha
On top Go back down the passageway to the ladder and go up
Here you can see the motionless water wheel and that the vertical wooden member is the end of a gate that is blocking the water from going to the water wheel
Turn the red wheel to move the gate and allow the water to get to it
But the wheel is not turning there are no paddles on it for the water to push
Next to the red wheel is an opening that used to contain a control to raise the paddles but Saavedro has sabotaged that also
Not to worry you have already done that through the broken observation window but there is one thing you must do first
Go back down the ladder and to the end of the passage where the gate is now in place and the water diverted
The shaft with the ladder is now free of water and you can go down
Open the wall panel where you can see the mechanism to engage the water wheel to the generator
Click on the crank to do that
This could not be done if the wheel were turning
Now go back up and raise the paddles through the broken window
The water wheel begins to turn and power is generated
Return again to the passage end and with power now established there is green light on the portal latch
Get across the turning axle and click on the latch so that the portal drops away and you can go down a ladder to another room
Here there is a viewer in which you can get another message from Saavedro
It is getting easier to feel sympathy for this guy
There is a tunnel with offset circular stepping stones that you should now follow to its end
Here is a very large cylindrical device of some sort in a large chamber heavy cables around the walls suggest that it might be electrical in nature
Perhaps a giant coil
Go down the ladder to the cylinder and you will see a symbol on it the Rivenese symbol for the number below which your cursor indicates that you can zoom in do this and a panel opens showing a matrix of heavy electrical conductors
This a simple exercise in which you are to click on the blue buttons to move sections of the matrix until you have a complete electrical path from the terminals at the top to those at the bottom
There are five of these panels to be found as you move around the cylinder and when you have successfully completed the circuits in all five this success is signaled by the last panel closing by itself
You may not have to do all five panels
Go back up the ladder to the tunnel and turn to observe that there are electrical discharges jumping from the top of the cylinder or coil to the grid above it presumably transferring energy upward
If you have not found more pages for Saavedro's journal as you went around the cylinder go back and look for them
Now find your way back through the tunnel up the ladder and through the entrance tunnel to the diagram by the ladder
All the symbols and connectors are lit except the top one which indicates the little island where you arrived
Continue along to the metal door that you unlocked from the other side
Now that there is power you can take care of the lava pit problem
Lava Pit Puzzle What you need to do is to get into the lava pit and turn on the fan so that air heated by the lava can fill the balloon airship in the cavern
Enter the control room where from an observation window overlooking the pit there can be seen in it a large gear that opens a gate to allow molten lava to enter the pit the motionless fan that needs to be turned on and below it the vertical member of a platform that is used to raise and lower the platform by a barely seen gear on the right
You can hear the bubbling lava and see its rosy glow through the obser vation window
Should you go down the ladder that is in the hole in the floor you would find the pit access hatch and looking through the viewing window in it you would see the glowing lava can't very well go in there with that in front of the entry
Go back up to the control room
In front of the observation window is a control unit in the circular face of which is a red knob used to rotate a lever around the edge of the face and also through the horizontal slot had it not been sabotaged Saavedro again by having a pin driven into it as you can see
However there is no impediment in the perimeter so you can grasp the red knob and drag it up then let it go and it will complete the travel around the circumference
As this happens you can see through the window the gear on the right lower the platform whereupon the bubbling ceases and the rosy glow is replaced by ordinary illumination signifying that the lava has drained away
Now you can go down to the pit access hatch click on the latch to open it and enter the pit
Turn left and go along the platform to another control identical to one above in the control room except that it has not been sabotaged
The platform moves up and down to one of three levels top middle or bottom it is at the bottom level as you enter
Above the vertical section you can see the indicator light of the fan switch just below the fan
You can now see better than from the control room observation window the overhead gear on the right that raises and lowers the platform by engaging the pegs on the vertical section
Note that there are pegs on each side of this section
The overhead gear assembly can be noisily moved from one side to the other by sliding the red knob from one side to the other through the slot in the control unit face
The gate that controls the lava may be seen on the left wall
When the overhead gear unit is moved to the left in addition to raising and lowering the platform it turns the large gear that controls the lava gate
If you are on the platform when there is lava in the pit you are safe though probably hot as long as the platform is not in the bottom position
Not to worry when the platform goes to the bottom position the lava drains from the pit
The platform cannot be raised or lowered more than one level without moving the overhead gear from one side to the other by sliding the control unit red knob lever through the slot
The overhead gear is made to turn by rotating the red knob around the control periphery and the gear turns in the same direction as the knob is rotated
If the gear cannot turn because of the limitation of platform movement then the red knob cannot be made to go around but it can always be moved back and forth through the slot
The finicky thing will sometimes do that when you don't want it to
You will have noticed the round aperture in the platform vertical section
When the platform is in its highest position through it you can reach the fan switch to turn it on
So that's what you have to do
Drain the lava enter the pit and raise the platform so that you can turn on the fan
Then lower the platform so you can leave the pit and in the control room move the platform to allow the lava back in so that the air blown by the fan is hot
To do the latter the overhead gear must be in the left hand position when you exit the pit
With hot air available to inflate the airship that's the thing to do
Leave the lava control room through the metal door and take the passage to the right which leads to the main walkway you took into the cavern
Be on the lookout for more pages to Saavedro's journal along the way
In the cavern you can operate the elevator at the end of the circular walkway now that there is power
The elevator takes you down to a lower walkway and at the end of this one is a lever which will cause the big hemisphere to open
It closes by itself after a short period
Go back up the elevator back to the main walkway and along it to the end
Climb down the ladder and move across to the platform with the tri colored gauge in front of the four wheel valves
Airship inflation puzzle Hot air that looks like steam is now coming from the valves above the three working wheels
Moving the floor lever to the right uses air pressure to raise the platform and gauge up one level repeat to go up one level more
Move the lever to the left to go down
Note the dotted red line in the blue part of the gauge at about o'clock your task is by opening and closing valves to bring the gauge needle to that line
Since air pressure is needed to raise the platform you have to close some valves to do this all three to get to the top level
The gauge is no help in indicating sufficient pressure to lift the platform
One approach is to move to the top level closing all the valves on the first two levels then work your way back down opening and closing valves and watching the gauge but this gets old pretty fast
When you get tired of trying here is a spoiler top level close right valve middle level open the two left valves bottom level all three valves open
The gauge needle should be close enough the dotted line
Go around the partition to the horizontal red wheel
Turn this valve and hot air flows to the airship which inflates and rises to free itself from its tether then moves along its guide cable until audibly stopped by the large hemisphere
You know what to do about that up to the main walkway along the circular one to the elevator down to the lower walkway to the lever that opens the hemisphere
The airship sails out moves a section of the lower walkway aside and stops
Go to the airship and get in the gondola
Pull down the bar and the airship follows its guide cable through the chasm motive power undisclosed and over the waterwheel until stopped next to another walkway outside
Go to the end of this walkway pull on another lever there and the walkway and airship swing forward making a connection between the power cable from the waterwheel generator system and the stone tower power cable
Improbably the tower and top of the island rise and become levitated with what appear to be many scraps of paper suspended below
Speculation is that the energy for this comes from big sparking coil you connected
Recall the generator in the J'nanin cot age
Get back in the airship gondola and pull the bar again whereupon the ship moves ahead to the small dock leading to the tower portal the lock for which is now glowing green
Click on the lock the portal falls away and you can enter the tower
At the center is a shaft with rings in it that serve as a ladder
Climb down the ladder and open the latch at the bottom
Gates swing aside and from this perspective the floating paper scraps form a pattern which is copied to a sheet that goes into inventory
You have found another of Saavedro's symbols
Pan upward to compartment doors in a panel above the gate latch
Click on the doors and they open to present the J'nanin linking book which takes you back to the room in Saavedro's retreat
J'nanin Age This will be your last return to Saavedro's retreat
Put the last symbol sheet on the blue disk and after a copy is made a walkway extends to the Narayan linking book on the open latticework football
Atrus appears on the ceiling congratulating his sons and tells them to go to Narayan
Open the book and do that
Narayan Age Here is one Age that does not seem to be set in a vast ocean
However during the linking process this place where you have been set down appeared to be surrounded by fog so perhaps there is water out there
You start in a more or less circular room with many panels of symbols along one side
All around are irregular loops of roots around the floor up the walls forming columns and wandering around the ceiling
Saavedro's journal made several references to a very important lattice tree splicing and weaving its roots so perhaps there is some connection
All of his loose journal pages have probably been found by now so it might be a good time to review what he has written
Some of it does not logically fit together and there are references to myster ious things that have not been seen but he writes much about Atrus and Sirrus and Achenar
He also admits to having been in a mental fog much of the time
On a raised area of this arrival room opposite the panels are a couple of spheres on short pedestals and between them on another pedestal is a lever switch with a large handle
Conduits run between the switch and the sphere pedestals
If you click on the spheres you get a noise as though they want to open but cannot
The most likely reason is that there is no power
Behind the switch is an impenetrable force bubble it looks like translucent plastic covering an exit from this room and to the right of this another opening covered by a lattice of roots or branches
Outside is a gondola hanging from a rope or cable
Finally to the right is a stairway
Go up the stairway and onto a large circular grid with illumination beneath
Immediately Saavedro comes out of a tower carrying the Relee shan linking book and his ever present mallet
He was expecting to see Atrus not you
He talks to you briefly then rants to himself for a while threatens you again and retreats back into the tower
Look around
There is another enormous tower or possibly a tree that extends up into the fog and some equipment that resembles artillery shell casings
Nothing responds to your cursor but a handle on a dome at the edge of the large grid turn it why not
That's what such handles are for
After a short period you hear the slowly rising hum of a generator and power is established
And now that you have good chance to observe it that fog surrounding the place appears in reality to be a translucent barrier resembling plastic with patches of bubbles and other irregularities in it
This must be the shield that Saavedro claims Atrus has established and which keeps him confined away from the rest of Narayan
There is nothing more to be seen up here so return down the stairs and turn your attention to the symbols on the wall
There are thirty of them each with a word under it indicating the significance of the symbol
Perhaps some of the symbols might make you think that you have seen them before
In your inventory look at the symbols you have gathered at the end of linking to the Amateria Edanna and Voltaic Ages
From Amateria you can recognize theforceandchangesymbols from Edanna those fornatureandencourage and in that from the Voltaic Age there arefutureandmotion
Now though there is no hint that you should do so examine Atrus' interminable journal you will find boldfaced expressions of his philosophy containing exactly those words
Here they are p Energy powers future motion Voltaic p Nature encourages mutual dependence Edanna p Dynamic forces spur change Amateria Don't stop there there is one more p Balanced systems stimulate civilization Note that each of these phrases consists of four words
With regard to the first three phrases in addition to the words mentioned above symbols for the remaining ones may also be found in the panels
The symbol forcivilizationin the last phrase is also to be found
For convenience screenshots of these words and phrases are reproduced on an accompanying page
Go to the switch between the two spheres and be sure the handle points to the sphere on the left then go to that sphere
Click on it now that there is power the pedestal rises
Click on the sphere for a closeup and again to open it and you will see three circles one for each of the Ages to which you have linked
Get a closeup of one of the circles to see in it four circles and in each of those four more symmetrically arranged so that there are twenty circle segments
Click on any of the segments and it turns red click on it again and the red disappears
Consider any of the above sentences say the first one Voltaic
In the top twenty segmented circle form the symbol forenergy moving cw to the next segmented circle form the symbol forpower and on around for the remaining two word symbols
When you have successfully formed the four symbols they all turn a brilliant white then recede so that you can get a closeup of another circle and repeat the symbol forming for another sentence then once more for the third sentence
With all three circles of symbols glowing white the scene shifts right and the force bubble over the room exit dissolves
Go out the exit where you can see that the gondola is not going anywhere because its cable disappears into the shield
There is another set of stairs leading to a room below which looks much the one you just left and there is another set of panels in which you can find the three missing symbols for those words in the last sentence
With this information return up the stairs but first be sure and get the Tomahna linking book next to the stairway and put it in your inventory
Go again to the switch and turn the handle to point toward the sphere on the right whereupon you will see that the force bubble returns
Open this second sphere as before and it you will find only one segmented circle set
Well of course you have only one sentence left
Build its symbols as you did for the others and when the red segment patterns turn white the shield disappears
Saavedro comes running from above in wonderment
Realizing that there might be life out in the pink mist he makes some statements plays with the switch alternating the appearance of either the shield or force bubble then says that he will return the Releeshan book if you will turn the switch and remove the shield when he is out next to the gondola
He goes out to it turns to you and says Do it
At this point save your game
There are quite a few endings to this game and you may enjoy trying them all remember Saavedro still has his lethal mallet
Also remember he still has the Releeshan book and he still has his well earned hatred for Atrus and Atrus' boys
One thing that you can do is as he demands turn the switch to dissolve the shield and trust him to leave the book behind as he departs in the gondola then turn the switch and get it before linking back to Tomahna
Or you can walk out to confront him to get the book and do nothing until he gives it to you
What you really should do is scoot up the stairway and turn off the power
Without power to support the patterns you established in the spheres the force bubble and the shield return trapping Saavedro between them
Now you are in control
Go back down and make him give you the book whereupon you have a decision to make you can link back to Tomahna and leave him trapped forever or you can decide he has suffered enough and you can turn the power back on and let him sail off into the pinkness where perhaps his wife and daughters await
Before you do that however be sure that the switch handle is turned to the right or you will regret your decision
Briefly
Link back to Tomahna to receive the grateful thanks of Atrus and Catharine
Catharine says that the fire from the fire marble destroyed the J'nanin linking book and they could not follow to help
Curiously it would seem that you have been gone a while but Atrus is still covered with soot from the fire
There is an epilog in which Atrus adds ever more words to his journal and the credits roll
Commentary Exile is a worthy companion to the previous two Myst games
The graphics are really outstanding the story flows along very well and the puzzles are intriguing
Playing is done using only the mouse and by a right mouse click you can choose to employ continuous or intermittent panning
Inventory is no problem because other than a few books and papers a total of seven at most there is no inventory such as is usually found in Adventure games
Game storage appears to be unlimited and there is a good sized thumbnail for each one actually too big to be called a thumbnail
Of course no game is completely perfect and a minor improvement would be to have more space for describing stored games also it would be nice if the cursor would indicate when forward movement is possible
There are philosophical contradictions that I find troubling
Among these are the fact that when it suits the plot only one linking book is possible yet there are several linking books to get you back to J'nanin from other Ages and in at least one Age there are two books
If Atrus has written a linking book such as the Releeshan one stolen by Saavedro why can he not write another one
Catharine says they could not follow you from Tomahna because the fire marble destroyed the linking book why not write another
You find that Saavedro has a linking book to Tomahna presumably somehow left by Atrus on J'nanin but Atrus expresses no concern about that
Because it is needed by the plot for you to return there
In one place Saavedro writes in his journal of the Narayan elders saying that the weaving of the lattice tree roots is a survival custom that has gone on for thousands of years yet in another place there is the claim that Narayan is a result of one of Atrus' linking books
Is Atrus immortal
Or is this another example of the continuing conundrum of whether the books establish the lands to which they link or just a path to them
I can not find nor can I recall any place in the previous Myst games where this is explicitly addressed
It seems pretty clear from Atrus' journal that he wrote Releeshan expressly to establish an environment for the D'ni to begin anew yet how could he have written Narayan which has thousands of years of tradition
Saavedro's journal tells us that Atrus spent several months in Narayan interfacing with the people and learning their ways as well as with Saavedro personally
Perhaps I have missed something but I cannot find any reason for him to put in place the shield that keeps Saavedro from Narayan as Saavedro claims he did
It is an act out of character for Atrus
When and why did he do this
It may be that Sirrus and Achenar did it but Saavedro attributes it to Atrus
Though Sirrus and Achenar do not appear in the game other than their pictures we learn from Saavedro that they have again proved themselves to be miscreants but there is no indication of whether Atrus still regards them benignly as he expressed in his holographic appearances on the ceiling of Saavedro's retreat
Has he found out what villains they remain and are they punished for their offenses or do they get away with them
The Voltaic age is another one of those islands in a sea
What gives rise to the water gradient used to turn the water wheel
The first time I played the game I had to set all five connections in the perimeter of the large coil in the Voltaic Age each new game since the first I only needed to set two
Exile is a superb game
Let us hope there will be more like it to continue the Myst series Soren Andersen Jan GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions

The Age Symbols Puzzle End Game Scenarios Chapter One Tomahna The Sun Room and Study The game opens for you at Tomahna high in the desert mountains
This is the residence Atrus has built for his new beginning with Catherine after he rescued her from the evil treachery of Gehn in Riven The Sequel to MYST
Catherine welcomes you with new baby daughter Yeesha in the Sun Room outside Atrus' study
She explains that Atrus will greet you shortly
He is busy checking the house over before they all leave on a vacation to visit the Releeshan Age where the survivors of the ancient D'ni civilization now live
Atrus is worried about the house being secure in their absence due to recent suspicious circumstances
When Catherine moves to the left side of the screen and sits on a garden bench to play with baby Yeesha enter the blue glass door of the Study
There are two doors
Your entry is on the left side
Once inside the room pan right and walk behind Atrus desk
You will see a leather bound book on an elaborate stand
Click on it
The D'ni emblem on the book's cover just may look familiar
It's the number five
It's the book for Gehn's Fifth Age
Open it to see the flaming holocaust left behind when Gehn's fragile work was demolished
Leave the book and swing left to see interesting but nonfunctional items on the shelf
Pan down left to the top of Atrus' desk
Read the message to Tamon from Atrus
Atrus is definitely worried about security at Tomahna
It appears some nefarious soul is sneaking into the Study and is reading Atrus' journals
You will also get a very brief history lesson involving MYST and Atrus' heinously wicked sons Sirrus and Achenar
After examining all the other inactive items on Atrus' desk look up and walk forward toward the encircled globe encased on a bronze pedestal across the room
Note the flaming red orange gem suspended from the right side of the frame work
It's a D'ni fire marble a source of light and great energy
Click once on the glass globe to view the Releeshan book
It is securely locked
Click again to be greeted by Atrus who apologizes for keeping you waiting
Atrus will give you his most recent journal concerning the Releeshan Age
Then he starts over toward his desk to get the key for the Releesahn book in the glass case
At this moment you are suddenly interrupted by the visitation of a wild looking apparent mad man
He grabs the fire marble and throws it starting a fire in the draperies near Atrus' desk
The glass dome breaks
You see the usurper take the prized Releeshan linking book use his own linking book to dematerialize and he is gone
The thief's book drops to the floor with a thud
And whether you like it or not you are going in after this strange creature Chapter Two J'nanin The Learning Age J'nanin is a barren island or so it appears
It has a fresh water lake in the middle at the bottom of a deep chasm
There are pathways ladders and stairways all over the island
This island age will be a learning experience for you
You need to find Atrus' linking books and learn their use First you need to find the thief and find out what he is up to
This ragged larcenist has ducked around the rocks up a pathway to your right
Go forward twice
Pan to your right to see a metal ladder going up the side of the cliff
Climb it
At the top pan down and cross the walkway to the thief's destination
It looks like an observatory of some sort
Go to the door and click on it
Through the portal you can will see the thief pacing about holding the Releeshan book
Try the door
You can't enter yet
Turn around and pan down to see that this observatory building appears to be built on a rock projection in the middle of the island's fresh water lake
Go back across the walkway and climb down to the middle level where you entered the J'nanin age
Don't continue down to the beach yet
Instead turn left along the short walkway and examine the pedestal with a reflector apparatus
Notice the red fire marble on top
Turn it by clicking on the lower circular handle
There are three positions
Through this reflector you will sequentially see water nothing and a view of a similar reflector some distance away
The other one has a purple fire marble gracing it's top
Back out of the view and go forward right of the pedestal toward the huge ivory tusk looking structure out beside the sea
Notice that odd looking black and gold motif at the base of the tusk
Go forward see a hole or well ahead of you carved into the rock to your left
Turn toward it Click forward and go down the ladder
Pan up and turn degrees to see that you are in a cave near the water line
Ahead of you is a door
But there's a strange elaborately decorated wheel obstructing your path to the door
You can't get over it around it or under it
Pan left toward the ocean
If you look carefully you'll see what appears to be a turquoise colored man made pillar out there
And just to the left of it you can barely make out another ladder on the cliff side
That looks like our next destination
You will see the top of the cave ladder just to the right of the cliff's edge
Go forward and climb down the ladder
Pan up and right to stand before the pillar you saw from the other side
Click on the left lever to see what happens to that wheel you encountered on the walkway The Wheel Puzzle To move the wheel out of the way so you can access the door in the base of the tusk click the left lever onceclick the right lever onceclick the left lever onceclick the right lever once Climb back up the ladder
Go left and back down the hole to the walkway
You will see the wheel resting harmlessly against the cave wall
Turn around
Go to the door and open it
This is the Amateria linking book room
The thief has apparently destroyed the room making it impossible for you to get across to the other side
Oh well you have plenty of other things to do here in J'nanin
Let's leave this place for now and explore the island
Take time here to read Atrus' journal appearing below your playing screen Atrus Journal Commentary on Releeshan Atrus decides not to rebuild the D'ni civilization
But rather to carry it's survivors forward into a newly written age in which the natural equilibrium of the world serves as a counterpoint to the upheaval of civilization
He considers making Nature the foundation of the new age
He contemplates nature encourages mutual dependence
Atrus muses that Nature would be a safer foundation than Energy which is forward moving and harder to control
Finally he decides he must include all three concepts under consideration for the new age in order to maintain a balance
balanced systems stimulate civilizations
When you have finished reading Atrus journal turn around and go back up the ladder
Go back across the walkway to the reflector with the red fire marble below the observatory
It should be to your right
Continue twice to the short walkway you see ahead
Turn left and pan down to see another ladder leading down to the sandy beach below
Go down the ladder and turn right
Keep going along the beach until you come to a second reflector pedestal with a yellow fire marble
Look through the viewer to see an interesting edifice in the ocean
Turn the viewer again to see an identical pedestal with a blue fire marble
Interesting
Turn to your left and go out on the rocky point to turn the wheel on the pillar jutting out of the rock there
Note that turning the wheel rotates the dome on the off shore structure and eventually opens it
Reflected sunlight is beamed to the booster projector to the left of the pillar
Leave the area and return to the yellow reflector pedestal
If you turn it again you will see that the reflected light projected by the off shore dome now shines on either the base of another tusk structure or on a rock area to screen right
Turn left and proceed until you come across a pedestal with no reflector on top
Obviously its broken
Could the thief be responsible for this destruction as well as that seen in the linking room
Remember where the broken pedestal is
Go forward on the left side of the pole four times
Turn right and descend the rock stairs through an area where the wind whistles and reverberates along the canyon walls
Follow the spiral staircase on down through the wind tunnel and to the water
There you will see a bridge leading to a lovely little garden house The Garden House Go across the bridge and open the garden house door
Step inside
Pan down and pull the lever on the column to the left
When the gate opens go forward into a small circular area
Pan down left to see another column with a large round button on it
Push it
When the gate behind you lowers go forward into the living quarters of the thief which is on the bottom floor of the observatory
Go right and look at the little stickman mobile on the rock table beside the hammock
Hmm
Could that be Atrus and his two infamous sons hung in effigy there
Turn left to see the animal hide hammock and pick up a journal laying inside the hammock
Read it all now
It is necessary to fill in the back story for you Saavedro's Journal Saavedro's journal reveals his twisted vengeful stalking of Atrus to seek justice for the death of his wife Tamra his two small daughters and the people of Narayan which was his home
He finds after a time that Sirrus and Achenar Atrus' sons aren't with him there at Tomahna
Remember that Saavedro's understanding is incomplete in addition to being deranged
He doesn't have Atrus' latest journal
You do Look at the symbols in some of the journals pages in the upper right corner
You will notice that some of the strange Narayan numbers are missing and or are out of sequence
Take note of the fact
Also take a good look at the drawings
Saavedro is quite the artist and you will need both his art work and his ranting as time goes along Turn around and go up the stairs across the room in front of the platform
Look on your left at the unfinished portrait Saavedro has been drawing
Obviously a beautiful woman
But she has no eyes
Is this Tamra
Did Saavedro leave her blinded so she couldn't see the ruins of Narayan
Or does he not want her to see the state that he is in and what he is up to Go forward right and forward to stand at the desk
Examine the scales the mortar and pestle and other items
To the left of the desk notice what appears to be a creature or plant in a shell
The device in the center of the desk is a battery
Turn the crank at the left
Click on the wires in the center to disengage them
Note that the plant creature extends a tentacle or root arm into the gap between the wires
Turn the crank again to reveal that this is an exotic Venus Fly Trap variety of plant Look at the scales on the right again
Note that one side carries four greenish blue crystal balls and the other side carries a single dark brown metal ball
Yet the scales are perfectly balanced Walk left to the stone table beside the hammock
Note that the scales there are also perfectly balanced
Yet the right side appears to hold four brown wooden
balls and the left side holds a single blue green crystal Could the different weights of these three materials contain the answer to the perfect balance
Or maybe it has to do with the fulcrum's position as in the mobile on the other side of the hammock
Go examine the mobile again and remember this exercise with the varying weights of different materials
You will need it later Go over to the round contraption in the corner of the room
It's an elevator
Let's see if you can get at the thief this way
Go around to the back of the elevator and click on the door handle to enter
Inside turn right and click on either lever you see
The elevator will rise In a cutscene you will see the thief secure the Releeshan book in a cage like contraption and send it down into a pit of some sort where you can't see it
You will not be able to gain access to it
At least not for the foreseeable future
Exit this view and turn around
Try to open the door
No go
Something else needs to be done here Look out the window
See the off shore light dome and the bigger booster projector you set up earlier Could it be that the appropriate arrangement of the various fire marble reflectors might shine the reflected lights of all the fire marble colors on the door and cause it or a tusk door to open
The alignment of the observatory door and the tusk doors provokes much further investigation For now let's go back down in the elevator
Close the door
Turn left and push the green button to return to the main floor
Step out of the elevator and turn extreme left
See the levers that work the elevator mounted on the wall
Pull the levers
The elevator will rise to the top floor again
When you regain the cursor pan down
See the area under the elevator Climb down there and examine the elevator's various mechanisms Saavedro has been destroying the works here also
Look at the diagrams in his journal to help solve these puzzles The Elevator Puzzle
Weights starting left to right click the left weight twiceleave the center weight aloneclick the right weight twice

Don't move it
But leave it positioned where you can see it through the opening
SwitchJust pull the rod toward you
GearsTurn the gears until the tooth on the lower gear and the hole on the upper gear line up
Look at the symbols in some of the journals pages in the upper right corner
You will notice that some of the strange Narayan numbers are missing and or are out of sequence
Take note of the fact
Also take a good look at the drawings
Saavedro is quite the artist and you will need both his art work and his ranting as time goes along

You will need it later
Go over to the round contraption in the corner of the room
It's an elevator
Let's see if you can get at the thief this way
Go around to the back of the elevator and click on the door handle to enter
Inside turn right and click on either lever you see
The elevator will rise
In a cutscene you will see the thief secure the Releeshan book in a cage like contraption and send it down into a pit of some sort where you can't see it
You will not be able to gain access to it
At least not for the foreseeable future
Exit this view and turn around

See the off shore light dome and the bigger booster projector you set up earlier Could it be that the appropriate arrangement of the various fire marble reflectors might shine the reflected lights of all the fire marble colors on the door and cause it or a tusk door to open
The alignment of the observatory door and the tusk doors provokes much further investigation
For now let's go back down in the elevator
Close the door
Turn left and push the green button to return to the main floor
Step out of the elevator and turn extreme left
See the levers that work the elevator mounted on the wall
Pull the levers
The elevator will rise to the top floor again
When you regain the cursor pan down
See the area under the elevator
Climb down there and examine the elevator's various mechanisms Saavedro has been destroying the works here also
Look at the diagrams in his journal to help solve these puzzles
Climb out of the pit under the elevator and use the wall switch to call the elevator
Climb aboard and rise to the top
Click the door handle and watch the cutscene where Saavedro uses a linking book to quickly escape your intrusion
The cage spins out of sight down below Turn right and open the elevator door
Step out of the elevator
Turn right around the balcony and pick up more pages from Saavedro's journal on the floor near the wall
Continue around the edge until you are at the spot where Saavedro was standing
See the blue button on your left there above the cage
Press it to see an opening of colored lights from the half domes on the walls
This is followed by a cutscene of a message from Atrus to his sons which has been contaminated and claimed as his own forum by Saavedro
Saavedro admonishes you to find three important symbols that will allow you to access the cage and the Releeshan linking book
After the cutscene go look through the viewers
Look through the viewer closest to where you are standing to the right of the blue button pedestal
You will see the symbol for the Voltaic Age
You need to align the symbol with its mate on the tusk structure for the Voltaic Age
Put the hand cursor on the view screen and move it up and right until you can see the Voltaic symbol on the tusk above the canopied door
Using the left handle to zoom in and out and the right handle for focus align the four tiny marbles around the edge to establish the etched symbol precisely over its counterpart on the tusk
When you get it right the four marbles around the viewer must be positioned as follows Voltaic Codeouter marble is about half way between the o'clock and the marks on the rim the second marble working to center is at the o'clock position the third marble is at the o'clock position the inner marble is at the o'clock position
Be sure to make a note of the positioning of the marbles
This is the first of the three puzzles you must solve and these marble codes are critical to your progression in the game
When you have completed the Voltaic viewer move to your left and pull the lever on the right side of the elevator sending it back down to ground level
Continue moving left to the Amateria viewer and repeat the process you used with the Voltaic viewer
When you have completed the code identification process here and noted the position of the four marbles i e captured the second code move to the third and last Edanna viewer and finish the final code identification Amateria Codeouter marble between and o'clock second marble between o'clock and third marble at o'clock inner marble at o'clock Edanna Codeouter marble between and o'clock second marble between and o'clock third marble at o'clock inner marble at o'clockReturn to the elevator and open the door
Cross over to the outer door and click on the bolts on the left door jamb to release them
Click on the door handle to open the outer door and walk out on the high walkway
Looks familiar doesn't it
It's just been quite a long time since the first time you stood here to watch Saavedro pace about inside the observatory
Go to the end of the walkway and go down the ladder to the walkway below and then on to the beach
Walk to your right until you come to the lighted yellow reflector pedestal
Rainbow Prism Puzzle Note The process of setting up the reflected light system to establish a prism color array at the Voltaic tusk would have been much simpler for you if Saavedro had not broken one of the reflectors
It's important here for you to write down thecolor orderof the reflector pedestals as you visit each one and establish their settings At the yellow reflector set it so you can see the blue pedestal nearby Walk to the blue reflector off to the right
You will see the ladder up on the rocks
Turn the blue reflector one time and direct the light to the green reflector across the chasm Go back down to the beach path and go left along the edge of the island
Cross the stepping stones and go up the stone slab past the purple reflector and down some steps
Go over two walkways together and climb rock steps to the left on the other side
Continue up to get to the green projector
Turn it once and check to see the red reflector right across from where you are standing Go to the red reflector
Turn it two times toward a yellow reflector clear across the chasm again
Go back down across the two walkways and climb up the rocks to the fork in the stairs
Go left
Climb up to the second yellow reflector
Turn it two times to reflect the light to the receiving purple projector Go down to the fork in the steps
Turn to the left and go up to the purple reflector
Turn it once
This will send the light beam to the red projector at just the point where you entered J'nanin and began to chase the elusive thief Saavedro Go down the rock slab and cross under the walkway on the stones
Go right and use the rock ladder
Once back on top go right to the red reflector
Turn it once
Look through the viewer on the left side to see the beam finally has come to rest on the prism device established in front of the entry to the Voltaic tusk Go back down to the beach
Go right and forward up the path until you reach the stairs
Go down a few steps to the fork and then go up left to the plateau of the Voltaic tusk Look at the array of lights created by the prism device
There are all the colors you visited
Do you recall all the colors in order
If you didn't write them down the proper order is yellowbluegreenredyellowpurplered The door to the Voltaic tusk will open
Inside look up and you will see the suspended cage with the Voltaic lining book tucked away safely inside
Pan down and press the button on the column in front of you Did you write down the marble code from the viewer exercise in the top of the observatory
The solution is a page or two back if you didn't
Once you place the marbles correctly press the middle button
The cage will descend with the Voltaic linking book
Click on it to open it and click on the picture to be transported to the beautiful and mysterious Voltaic Age Chapter Three The Voltaic Age Age of Energy Where the J'nanin Age symbolized a learning of lessons the Voltaic Age is one of the three element ages revealed at J'nanin in Atrus' journal
The other two are Amateria The Age of Dynamic Forces
And Edanna The Nature Age
Here in Voltaic you must find its symbol and various scattered journal pages left behind by Saavedro and return the symbol to J'nanin
When you arrive in the Voltaic Age you are facing a small circular rock building set atop a little island
Go forward and left along the walkway
Turn right to see the hatch of what appears to house some sort of power supply maybe
Try the hatch lock with no luck
Turn left to see a winged metal object modern sculpture
in a small side area
Go to it and open it
This winged sculpture houses your ticket back to J'nanin
It's the J'nanin linking book
At least you know you can get back there at any time you want to
Go back to the little circular intersection and go right out to the pier
Look back over your head to the route of the main power cable and examine the various structures apparently created to generate electromagnetic power
In addition to finding the proper symbol and more journal pages it appears that you will need to establish a functional power source on this island
Or perhaps in order to find that precious symbol reestablishing power is the requisite task
Go back to the little intersection around the building to the right and across the walkway to the cliff side
Enter the chasm of the main island
When you pass through the cliff side keep going on down the walkway to briefly explore the chasm and the various structures erected in it
The whole scenario will make more sense to you if you do this first
Walk along to the tube like structure you see on the right
Walk past it to the intersection and go right
Follow the semicircular path to end up facing a small metal elevator housed inside of the tube
Turn around and try the lever on your left
But you will find that the elevator is not functional yet either
Step back out and look down to view some of the various levels and walkway erected here
Go left again to the intersection where you came down to the elevator
Go right
Look at the huge round wheel mechanism to the right of the walkway and the scaffolding suspended across the top of the chasm
Could that be some kind of track
Turn back left and walk along past the big wheel
Look right to see what appears to be an air ship
Look at the walkway off to the right
Go down the ladder across the walkway to another cylindrical platform
These are the controls for the air needed to inflate the air ship
But there's no power here yet to do that
Turn around and go forward to see that the walkway has suffered greatly under the hands of Saavedro
You can't get out there
Go back up the walkway past the big wheel and climb the ladder to get back on top where you started
There is much to see and there are many levels to explore
Remember that passageway off to the right you passed on your way into the chasm area
Let's take a look down there now
Go back past the elevator to the big crack in the canyon wall
As you approach the exit that leads back to the little island turn left and enter the copper colored lighted tunnel
As you follow the walkway keep an eye out for more pages from Saavedro's journal
When you reach the intersection you will see a door metal hatch off to your left
Go forward and open the hatch using the red handle
Go forward to the view window to see the various mechanisms required to inflate the air ship with hot air
Notice how hot it is in here
NOTE If you have not already been up the maintenance ladder to the left of the elevator where the round gauges are and have accessed this room through the ventilation ducts you will not be able to open the door
Its optionalbut not necessary to investigate this control room at this point
You can check out the red knobbed control handle on the pedestal in front of you and move the mechanisms around a bit
You might note that the center of this pedestal has been jammed with some sort of pin
Saavedro's work again no doubt
Turn around and walk around the ladder to go down under the control room
Walk forward and open the viewer to see that this chamber contains molten lava
This has to be where the hot air comes from for the air ship
Go back up into the control room and go forward once toward the window
Look up
This must be a ventilator shaft to direct the hot air to the air ship
Let's save investigation of the ventilation system until we've checked out another area and maybe start to get a few things accomplished here Leave the control room using the red handled door
Walk forward and take the new route down the blue tunnel The Water Wheel Puzzle This new path leads to the main power plant
Just before you go up the steps in the lighted rock chamber turn right and look at the green diagram on the tunnel wall
The symbols represent various places or structures in the Voltaic Age
The black lines between the symbols will be lighted if when power is flowing as it should
As you can see there is no power the top symbol is the little island the three in the middle left to right are the water wheel the electromagnetic chamber and the walkway elevator the lowest symbol represents the magnet You can make a note of the symbols and their use if you like
But its not really necessary
Turn left and walk ahead to the circular metal hatch
You should be hearing a lot of rapidly moving water by now
The hatch won't open until power is restored
But note this one's similarity to the one on the little island where you came in
Turn to you right and look down
There's the waterfall you've been listening to the source for generation of this age's electric power
There's a gate right behind that copper colored tube with the ladder
Go look
The tube is full of water but obviously the ladder indicates that this circumstance can be changed Turn to the right and go back down the tunnel to the small intersection at the base of the steps
Turn right and climb the ladder
You are in the control room for the power station
Pan down to see that one of the control wheels have been severely damaged and is inoperable
Saavedro has been here too
The red wheel on the right controls the gate however
So you can control the gate's operation
Turn the wheel
Water will be admitted to the water wheel area
The water wheel is that huge horizontally seated cylinder you are looking at
The broken control wheel manipulates the inner workings of the water wheel
We'll take care of that in a few minutes
Leave the control room and turn left
Go back over to the area where you saw the waterfall
Wow what a drastic change in the view
The sluice gate is now in a totally different position and water has been directed under the wheel
Go down that ladder you saw in the tube earlier
If there's still water in the tube go back up to the control room and turn the wheel again
At the bottom of the ladder turn around and press the big red button
You are looking at a huge gear assembly
The gear must be used with the water wheel gear to turn it
This action produces electricity for the entire island
Click on the crank on the left side of the gear to reengage it
Saavedro has released it so it doesn't work
When it is raised into place again climb back up the ladder
Go back down the tunnel
Stop just before you get to the stairs and turn right
You should see a broken window in the view port with some sort of mechanism visible beyond it
This is the paddle device for the water wheel
Click on it
The paddles will engage and start to move
This is the manual way to get around the fact that Saavedro sabotaged the second wheel in the control room
The power is now on from the water wheel to the electromagnetic chamber
Note that the tunnel begins to shudder with the turning of the waterwheel
Turn left and go down the steps
Turn left again to look at the diagram and see that the power line between the water wheel and the chamber is lit
Go back up the stairs and down the vibrating tunnel
Look down to see a view of the water wheel turning under the platform
And the circular top of the gear is turning at your feet right in front of the chamber hatch
You will see that the green entry light is now lit
Open the hatch
Go down the ladder to find yourself in another chamber
Turn to the right and click on the viewer controls the black portal to see another cut scene of Saavedro blaming Atrus for not better supervising his errant sons Sirrus and Achenar
Turn right after the cutscene and go on down the tunnel with the off set stepping stones
The Circuit Cylinder Puzzle At the end of this tunnel you will enter another large area with a huge squatting cylinder in the center
Proceed down the ladder and look up to see the D'ni number on the panel above you
Walk around the cylinder left or right to see four other panels with the D'ni numbers and
Back at the first panel you will see a hot spot between the two cross bars below the D'ni number
Click on it
This is an aperture
One of five
You must line up the disconnected circuits beginning with the permanently fixed ones at the top and bottom
There can be no gaps in the connections
When you have created perfectly joined circuitry in all five panels electricity will jump from the cylinder to the coils arrange on the chamber walls
You can easily solve this puzzle using different methods
The two methods I found easiest would probably be to do one complete panel at a time
Or you could establish the circuitry from the top down or bottom up walking around the cylinders
This way you would establish all the top moveable circuits first then all the middle and then all the bottom
When you get it right all five panels of the cylinder will close
Anyway you decide to complete the puzzle its not difficult and once you have all the circuits intact go back up the ladder where you came into the chamber and watch the arcing electricity on top of the cylinder
Success
Go back down the ladder and find more of the journal pages that Saavedro has left for you on the floor in front of the D'ni number panel
Read Saavedro's journal periodically to keep up to date with his twisted response to the tragedy at Narayan
Who could help but be traumatized after what happened to his home and family
Go back to the ladder and make your way through the tunnel with the off set stepping stones to the chamber ahead
Turn left and go up the ladder and out through the hatch
Makes sense to check the power flow diagram again now to see if you have everything running smoothly
Go on down the steps and turn left
Darn
There's one structure which still has no electric power the little island
Turn right and continue down the tunnel
At the intersection where you see the red handled hatch on your right go left instead and continue on up to a blank wall
Turn left and go out to the little island
You can see the water wheel turning now from the end of the pier
But it seems the hatch door on the building is still locked tight
Maybe we can now do something with the air ship back in the chasm
You know that the elevator should be working now
Go back into the canyon and take the right path at the intersection
Go to the little elevator and get in
Pull the lever and go down to the next walkway
Walk out to the big wheel mechanism and pull the lever in the cage at the end
Ah so now you see what it's for
The entire wheel opens like a fan for the air ship to pass through the elaborate doors
It's a sort of hangar arrangement
Go back up in the elevator and on to the main pathway
Turn right at the intersection and go all the way to the end
Look down right and descend the ladder
Go back to the control panel for the air ship and turn right
Try the controls
Still nothing
Turn to look at the broken walkway which apparently provided the route to access the air ship
Turn to your right and see a metal ladder
Go forward up the ladder three times
Turn and get off into the bucket shaped cage ahead of you
Look down on the grilled flooring to find more of Saavedro's journal notes
Come up and turn around to see a giant hatch
Open it and go through to the brightly lit chasm side
Walk across the long track or pipe
Hopefully you aren't afraid of heights
Go through the next hatch at the end of the pipe and to the right
It's very dark in here after the hatch closes
But just go forward until you can't anymore and then turn around
Go back one click and look down
Click on the grate and drop down on the floor of the control room for producing hot air
This is a familiar place
Turn around and go down the ladder
Look at the molten lava again through the viewer
You'll need to open this door but not just now obviously
It would be just a tiny bit lethal
Go back up to the control room in front of the window
Look at the pedestal below the window with the red knob
Saavedro has also sabotaged these controls by pounding a metal pin into the center
But it is still partially operational
The Molten Lava Puzzle Note If you click once on the red control knob then release the mouse button the cursor holds onto the knob and follows your motion up or down a little If you click again toward the direction you want the knob to go it will swing around the entire circle freely Otherwise it can be extremely stubborn
Move the knob up and around counterclockwise to the left
It should click a couple of times going nearly all the way around counterclockwise and returning to its original position
You will see the gears moving through the control room window
Go back down the ladder and use the handle beside the view on the molten lava hatch to open it
If you are successful it will open to establish that you used the red knob on the pedestal correctly
If there's still lava in the chamber go back up and try again
Open the hatch and enter
Turn left and go forward through the railings where you see a red knobbed pedestal like the one in the control room
Only this one is completely intact
Move the red knob in a clockwise direction so the platform rises
The move the knob again so that it is positioned to pass through the middle slot
Let go of it and watch the gear up to your right go over your head and lock on to the larger gear to the left
Swing right and look at the apocalyptic painting on the wall
More of the talented but tortured Saavedro's work Well what now
Nothing more is happening
Try the red knob again
Move it counterclockwise right around the bottom of the ring
Whoa cool
Or rather HOT
The lava chamber has filled again
But look you can go forward past the pedestal now and turn on the fan
See the red glow in the circular panel ahead of you
Turn on the fan
Then return to the control pedestal
After all you can't go anywhere else right now At the pedestal lower the platform a bit by moving the red knob clockwise around the center
The fan is turning
Now move the red knob again to the right to reposition that first overhead gear back over on the right side in front of the painting
Then pull the red knob counterclockwise to move the platform to floor level and simultaneously drain out all the molten lava
The fan is now blowing the hot air necessary to inflate the air ship but you need to move that overhead gear back over to the left and engage it to complete the process
Pass the red knob back through the center of the pedestal
Leave and go back up to the control room
At that upper control room pedestal move the red knob counterclockwise
This action will raise the chamber platform again and allows the lava to flow back in
Now you have turbo hot blowing air
Look up to see the open end of the ventilation shaft
Hop in and skeedaddle out of there
Time to see if you can get the air ship inflated
When you come out of the ventilation shaft turn right go forward left and cross the pipe again to the other side
Go down through the shaft on the opposite side
Go through the bucket shaped platform you may notice steam coming up from beneath it now and go down the ladder
Once on the wing shaped platform turn left to the air ship control panel
The Air Ship Valve Puzzle There are three levels of valves each
This is the bottom level you are standing on
The first three valves should be open left to right and emitting hot air
The fourth valve on the right has been disabled by you know who
You can't fix it Look down at the pressure gauge and your pressure should register at about
Going counterclockwise you want to establish pressure at where the dotted red line is
That's the air pressure you need to develop to fill the air ship with hot air
Remember the number
Now it would appear relatively simple to do this getting the pressure set at
However there's a rather influential caveat here
There are three tiers of valves to work with and the elevator also uses hot air to operate
Though not apparent by looking at the gauge this decreases your accumulated pressure every time you move it
The elevator is pneumatic
When you see hot air steam the valve is open and you lose pressure
There's a straightforward way to get the valve puzzle solved
And that's simply to greatly overbuild the pressure
Use the lever on the left pulled to the right to raise the elevator up two more levels to the top tier
Establish the pressure at halfway into the red zone on the gauge
Then work your way back down to the middle and bottom level as follows Starting on the bottom level close all three working valves nd level close all valves Top level close the right valve only nd level open the two left valves Bottom level open all three operable valvesThe long side of the needle on the gauge should be just a hair to the right of the required number mark
Good
Close enough
Swing around and go left forward once
Swing to the right to see a red handled cylinder that looks like an air tank
Turn the handle
You should hear air escaping
Watch as the hot air flows up the hose and inflates the air ship
It loosens from it's moorings and sails forward
Unfortunately it slams into the closed hangar doors
Well hopefully there's no damage
And we sure do know what our next move is Pan down and follow the walkway up through the valve control area and on across the walkway up the ladder and to the uppermost walkway of the canyon
Walk ahead to the intersection and go down to the elevator
Get in the elevator and use the lever on your left to go down a level
Get out and go left along the walkway to the upright lever at the end
Pull it
Watch the air ship leave the hangar
The air ship moves forward pulls the walkway a bit and hesitates there
What are you waiting for
The future calls
Climb aboard Turn left and pull the handle
You will surely be impressed with the air ship ride through the chasm
When the gondola comes to rest opposite the little island get off to the left and go to the lever at the end of the walkway
Pull the lever
Watch the gondola move forward engaging the walkway and again moving it forward
Then see the little island split in a huge rift all the way around the stone building and rise into the air
Go right back to the gondola
Get in and push the handle to sail up to the stone building's new position hovering above its foundation
Truly surreal
Get out on the right and go down the walkway to the hatch now showing a green light and open it Go forward to the shaft and climb down
At the bottom look down to see a small wheel
Turn the wheel
That's the symbol for Energy you see floating there before your eyes
You will automatically capture it and store it in your inventory
Pan upward then to see a hot spot in front of you
Click on it
The doors will open and the J'nanin linking book will be presented
Time to go back to J'nanin with your first captured prize the Energy symbol
Go over to the blue imager on the observatory platform above the blue button
Remember what Saavedro said about finding the three hidden symbols
Wonder what he'd say now that you have the energy symbol
Place the symbol from your inventory on the imager
It will cause the cage to appear from below
Afterward you will receive another hologram message from Saavedro
He recognizes you have found one of the three symbols and tells you more about the Lattice Trees of Narayan and the damage the brothers caused there
Afterward go outside via the elevator door on the high walkway
Now you need to find the next linking book to take you to Edanna or to Amateria
Go down the walkway down the ladder across the lower walk and take the rock ladder down to the beach
Turn left
Go under the walk to the stone ramp
Go up the ramp and forward up the stone steps
At the fork turn left and go down to the walk you can see at the base of the next tusk
Go across the first walkway
When you get to the rock pillar before the next walkway turn left to see a ladder
Go down the ladder
Stop to enjoy a ride on the purple and yellow Hearken Fern to hear amplified sounds from around the chasm
Can you hear water from the beach near the green house
Get out of the fern and look up at the Barnacle Moss above you and the seemingly unreachable door to the Edanna Age tusk
There's no obvious way to climb up there
Turn around go left past the fern and climb the ladder down to the beach
Go straight across the stepping stones and over to the cute little Squee's tent
Turn right and click on the spiky plant in the water in front of you to flatten it
Then turn back left and click on the bulb atop Squee's tent
You have provided a bridge for him to reach the Barnacle Moss
He has aquaphobia No just kiddin' he just can't swim
He will use the plant to cross over to the moss
When he runs over there to indulge himself notice that when he chirps the moss inflates significantly Wonder if this process could be useful up on the cliff side
Let's see if you can use the fern to pick up and amplify those Squee chirps to inflate the moss up there by the Edanna tusk
Leave Squee I know its tough and go back up the ladder and ride the Hearken Fern again
Aim the fern toward Squee
You'll hear him chirping happily away
When you get the fern positioned correctly a cutscene will play showing you your new route to the unreachable door
Climb up there clear to the top and walk across to the door
Open the door
Walk across to the pedestal
Input the correct marble code
Retrieve the Edanna Age linking book from the cage
Edanna Codeouter marble between and o'clocksecond marble between and o'clockthird marble at o'clock inner marble at o'clock
The cage will descend
Click on the book clearly marked Edanna
Click on the picture to link to the beautifully vertical Edanna age Chapter Four Edanna The Nature Age Right off the bat here remember what you are here for
You must find the second of three symbols
In accomplishing this primary goal you will discover the plant and animal species in this age and the interdependencies symbiosis between them
Think of Edanna as an inverted foot high tree
All the flowers foliage and animals are on the inside of this tree structure
You open at Edanna's middle level facing a huge pink flower with what looks like a bulbous magnifying glass in the center
It's hanging it front of a cage of twisted wood
It looks like something is in the cage doesn't it
You can't quite get to it
But you can click on the pink flower's center to find that it is a magnifying lens
You will see that the linking book back to J'nanin appears to be held organically and securely inside
You can only go one direction for now
So pan right and go along the path through the tunnel you see there
Click forward times until you stand at the base of a strange pink spiral shaped plant
This is a Corkscrew Cattail
Click on it for a scenic ride to the top of Edanna's uppermost level
Turn right to view the ocean through an opening
You'll be surprised by a giant colorful bird carrying some kind of food to it's nest
Walk over for a closer look
Use the pink lens flower to see that the bird is feeding it's cute little chick
Turn and go down the path where you see that the cattail is drawing water from an organic basin of collected water
Follow the vine up to the top of the cattail with your cursor to see how that works
Turn back to the left toward the bird
Pan down beneath the bird's nest to see another twisted stick cage
Turn completely around again and go back down to the cattail
Turn left and go through that opening toward the ocean
Turn left again to see a twisting greenish bough leading upward
Follow it
You will see the bird take off again to find more food
Before you continue on up turn left to see a wilted cattail
If you follow its vine on down to the nearby basin you will see that it's water supply has been used up or has evaporated
Poke that big greenish veined melon thing there
It's definitely full of liquid probably water
That would make sense wouldn't it
But it looks like this particular symbiotic arrangement needs a bit of your encouragement
Turn right and climb all the way to the top where you see a plant that is obviously a variety of palm
Go right on up to it and press that bluish circular bulb in the center
The palm fronds close up and leap for the sky
Pan down and to the right now to see what they were hiding
It's a second linking book back to J'nanin
With that reassurance turn completely around and go over to the orange and yellow flower on the cliff's edge
This is an Aurora Blossom
Click on it
It's also a variety of lens flower
The palm fronds have been moved away now directing sunlight through the flower's lens
Pan around until you see the dry basin by the wilted cattail plant below
See that black scar on the tree just above and right of the basin
It looks like the tree has been burned
This probably gives you an idea on how to quench the thirst of that poor cattail
Well if not direct the brilliant hot spot from the lens to the green melon shaped plant full of water
The melon will burst filling the basin with cool water
The vine quickly carries the water to the cattail and it unfurls providing a new means of transportation for you
Leave the close up of the Aurora Blossom and turn around left
Head back down the path to the now available cattail
Climb aboard for a long trip to Edanna's lower level
When you arrive at the bottom turn left and start down the big branch toward the little palm trees you can see
Go three clicks forward
Pan left a bit
Go toward the pink light
The little pink electric sting ray is shocking the roots trailing into the water and is eating from them
Turn left and continue down the path of branches where you will now see beautifully glowing lavender moss on many branches
It's much darker and cooler at this level
At the base of the branch see another pod like plant on the right
It looks like the pod or melon on the upper level after the water was drained from it
Go forward and click on it for a close up
Then click on the reddish growth at the front of the pod
Watch the water come down the vine bringing the little pink ray with it Turn around and start down the yellow lighted tunnel on the right
You should immediately see more pages from Saavedro's journal
Pick them up and read the new pages
Keep on going down the tunnel until you come to a big branch leading off to the right and you see a drop off into the vegetation that looks pretty dangerous
There are some interesting looking objects across the way
Turn right to walk along the limb toward a log brightly covered with Barnacle Moss
This we recognize right away
You may hear some creature noises or bird calls along the way here also
But just keep going across the moss to the next limb
Turn right and go into the lavender lit tunnel ahead of you
Spiraling right go forward three times until you see a large yellow lighted gourd hanging by vines in front of you
Pull the ball on the bottom of the vine
The gourd opened up and provides a great deal of much appreciated light
The leaf behind the gourd now unfurls providing a new pathway for you to explore
The Squee Puzzle Walk to the end of the leaf and look up
Grab that bluish green vine
Your cursor will change to look like the handle of a trapeze bar the end of the vine
Turn completely around to see a tent structure behind you
Use the vine cursor to swing over there
Visually follow the rope attached to the top of this tent trap to the small pedestal behind it
Go over to the pedestal and turn the crank
The tent will rise
Go forward to the pink fruit and knock one down onto the ground
Click on the pink fruit to roll it forward once along the crack
Go back past the pedestal and down the dark tunnel behind it
When you pick yourself up go degrees right back into the tunnel
Pan right again and go forward
Pan right again and go forward again to the lighted gourd
Pan down a bit and go down the length of the leaf
A cut scene shows you an adorable little Squee who's come for the pink fruit
Pan down right and see that trapeze handle
Pull it
If you catch the little Squee you forgot to roll the fruit forward in the crack and the Squee will be pathetically crying
The tent trap should come down beside Squee scaring him off across the rotten log bridge you came across with all the moss on it
When Squee squeaks the moss expands right
Watch as the log comes apart and Squee runs safely off into the forest with his prize
Do you suppose that Saavedro placed that rotten log there
It did look a bit out of place here didn't it
Go down the length of the leaf again with your back to the Squee trap where the rotten log was
Click on that hanging vine again
Place the vine cursor over the flat lighted area ahead of you
Swing over there
Turn left and go down the tunnel to a new area
Walk over to the lighted gourd
Pull the ball hanging down from the vine and unfurl the leaf
Don't walk across the leaf yet though
Instead the lighted gourd reveals better visual access to the lavender lit area to your right
Walk over there where the little round hole is
Turn left and follow the path
Go forward five times down the winding path to find a huge Venus Fly Trap to the left of the path The Venus Fly Trap Bird Puzzle The poor mother bird is caught in the fly trap
Unless you intervene its croak city for her and probably for her chick
This is your next Edanna test
Turn right and see the triangular opening where the ocean is visible
Click four times forward to go through the opening
Turn left and go along the yellow lighted path
Follow the path down until you come to another round melon like pod along the path to the right
Go one click beyond it
Turn around
Click on it to go forward and view another example of Saavedro's artistic talent
The painting depicts the treachery of Sirrus and Achenar
Beneath the painting are Saavedro's palette and paints
Click on the melon pod to inflate in and again capture the itinerant little pink ray
Step back on the path and turn right looking down the path
Go forward one time
Here the path splits in two around the spikey roots of the carnivorous fly trap plant
Take the left path for now
At the bottom of this path you will see a green lighted area with a huge organic basin like the ones that water the cattails above
Click on it to bring water and the little pink ray right on down to this area
Wonder if we loosed the ray to zap those roots if the fly trap would be shocked enough to release mother bird
Go one click forward past where you can see the ray swimming in the pod
Pan down right
Go forward three times and pan slightly right to see some sort of man made apparatus sitting on a limb
Oh its another viewer
Go over and push the big metal button in front of the viewer to receive another anguished message from Saavedro
Turn left and continue down the path
See that curled up leaf there to the left and up
But there's no gourd to light up and unfurl the leaf
Go all the way back up the path to where Saavedro's painting is
Turn completely around and take the left path
Be sure to carefully follow the huge vine that winds down
Stop when you see a white orchid hanging to the right of the path
With that white surface you might be able to get some additional light reflected down in here
If you turn left here you will see another big white orchid and of those Aurora Blossoms across the way
Reflected light must be the answer to this dilemma
Go on down the path once
Click on the next orchid off to the left
Get a close up view
This flower also has a lens
Place the viewer so you can see the leaf across the way
Come out of the close up
Continue right down clear to the end of the path and stop
You should see bright sun light below you
Turn around to face the back side of another huge white orchid
Click on the bottom rear of the flower or on the vine
Turn the lens so that you are positioned right on top of the reflective glow from the second orchid
The light will pulsate when combined correctly
Be sure that you position the light on the second orchid to the left of the big tree limb in front of you in the viewer Go back up the path to the second fern to see through the lens that the leaf is now unrolled making a new path
Make sure you leave the lens position correctly or the leaf will rewind itself
Go back up to Saavedro's painting
Turn around and take the left side path down to the electric ray in the basin
Go back behind the basin just follow the edge around to the right and down in the dark to the now unfurled leaf
Cross the leaf and go up right through the glowing mushrooms
At the top you should see the Aurora Blossom the ray and basin in the same view
Walk past the blossom and up the steps to another white orchid the fourth one
Manipulate it until the Aurora Blossom is at the center of the lens
Go back down the steps past the blossom on your right and on ahead to the hollowed out log with the lighted mushrooms
Go inside and go forward just once
You can see the ocean through an oval shaped hole
Pan up a little bit so you can see that the hole is separated around a large log or branch
Go one click forward
There's another route through the log at the right
But for right now pan down left and take that lighted mushroom path down At the bottom hop on the leaf and turn left
Go across the leaf then right up the path
At the basin continue on going up toward Saavedro's painting again
When you get there turn around
Go forward toward that big root again to the right of the spiky fly trap roots
Go down the steps and follow around to the left to the third white orchid out near the ocean where you first found the sunshine
Click on the lens and center it on the first orchid now which is just to the right of the big limb you can see in the lens
When you have it right the pod melon will break open and spill the water and the pink ray into the basin
The little ray immediately goes to work shocking the roots of the Venus Fly Trap
Hooray
Mother bird is free
After she flies back to her chick look through the lens again and move the bright light back to the left side again to unroll the leaf
You need it
Go back up to the painting
Turn around and come down the left path again to see a close up of the basin and the electric ray at work
Go down behind the basin again
Go along the path to the hallowed out log
You will pass the viewer again where you heard Saavedro's last message
Continue on down
Cross the leaf to the hollow mushroom log
Climb up to the top and turn around where you see the ocean and sky view split by a branch or log
Pan right a little
See the light inside that other log
That's where you want to go next believe it or not
Follow along this left bearing mushroom lit path out to where you see the ocean again
Watch for more of Saavedro's journal pages in the log
Click on the bee hive looking plant to get another trapeze bar cursor
Click to swing straight down to the newest pathway
Follow the path to the right where the twisted branches look rather like steps
At the top you will find yourself enveloped by a rather slurpy sounding flower and transported back up to another limb
This is your way back up to the Fly Trap area if you want to return
To go on down to the swamp take the trapeze ride again and for forward down the flat walk to the left of the stairs
When you can go forward no further just one click ahead turn left and go down into a murky blue and lavender area The Purple Pod Puzzle Look at the huge round seed pod to the right
Go forward five times and turn left to see another path strewn with white cup mushrooms
Veer back right and continue up into the dark
At the top of this path you will find another huge white orchid
Look through the orchid's lens and position it to lock on pulsate when you see the two tendrils stand upright in the bright light on top of the huge purple pod
Go clicks forward down the path
Look to your right to see the cupped white mushrooms marking the entry to the other path you found on the way up
Go clicks forward and stop
Turn right to see the little insects over the top of an open purple pod
You need to get those insects to fly over to the other seed pod you hopefully just opened with the reflected light
Turn right and go around the side of the seed pod and up to where you see a palm
Push on the bulb at its base to make it rise up and block the sun from the open pad and the insects below
Now let's go see if the insects took off for the other pod
Go down the path clicks bearing right
Well this seed pod has closed all right but those stubborn insects are still hanging out
Turn back left and go on up this path until you reach a long tubular flower laying on the ground with a round hole in its side
Beside it down left sits a round mushroom chock full of nasty smelling spores
Turn back right and continue examining mushrooms going ahead slowly until you find the biggest one Click on it to release its insect repellent spores and watch the little buzzers take off out of there as fast as they can fly
Go back over to the tubular flower with the hole and hop right inside of it
Go down the length of it and be sure to pick up more of Saavedro's notes on the way
You will come up inside the seed pod complete with buzzing insects
Make your way as far up into the pod as you can get
Then turn and click on the center stalk where you get a hand icon
A huge cloud of purple spores will emit and the mother bird will immediately pay you a visit
She picks up the seed pod with you tucked inside
Off you go to her nest
Don't be afraid she'll not harm you
She's your new best friend
Pan around and down at the base of the pod until you find a place at the left of the birds where you slide out and down a limb
Aha
There's the Edanna symbol you came for
Turn left and go forward once
See the J'nanin linking book held there
Click on it
Click on the picture to go home to J'nanin and the observatory
Walk around to the imager
Take the Edanna symbol and place it on the imager
Watch it be manipulated just as the Voltaic symbol was and neatly stored away in the descending cage
Listen to and watch Saavedro's seemingly less bitter and much calmer message
One more symbol to go before we go on to Narayan
Remember at the beginning of J'nanin when you first arrived and moved that big wheel out of the way down in the cave by the water
Leave the observatory via the elevator and the high walkway
Go down to the walk and out to the tusk beyond the red fire marble projector
Go out to the furthest point on the rocks and down the ladder on the right
Use the wheel to roll it back into the now open linking book room at the base of the Amateria tusk
Using the levers on the pillar click the left leverclick the left leverclick the right leverclick the right lever The wheel will roll into the linking room with a resounding crunch
Climb the ladder back up cross the rock and go down the now familiar hole
Go down to the little room
Step on the wheel that has now filled the hole Saavedro created in the floor
Approach the pedestal
Set up marbles in the correct code for Amateria outer marble between and o'clock second marble between and third marble at o'clock inner marble at o'clock
The cage with the Amateria book will descend
Click on it to open it
Click on the picture to link to Chapter Five Amateria The Age of Dynamic Forces Wow
this looks like an over the water oriental amusement park
Surrealistic as all get out isn't it
And its getting dark to boot
What a sunset
One couldn't help but wonder if this age was created when Sirrus and Achenar were younger perhaps just for fun
From where you are standing turn right to see a large central building with an interestingly shaped pagoda tower
You can't cross the gaps in the bridge here
Turn back left to settle on a hexagonal box containing white buttons
Approach the box
You will need to solve this puzzle and two of its counterparts to cross the bridge
But that comes much later
Turn back left to go back to the intersection
Turn right and go across the bridge
At the interim covered area turn right to see your back up J'nanin linking book
There's another one
Turn back and cross the second section of the bridge
Walk through the rock entry and take the very narrow steps down to the lower level
Just keep panning down and follow the blue lights if you aren't sure where to go
At the bottom go forward four clicks until you are facing a yellow fire marble lantern
There's a wooden walkway over the water on the left and another path into the building on the right
Since it looks like a storm is coming and it getting dark let's take the right path further into the building
You will see a little elevator off to the left
Get in and look down to pull the lever
Step out on the platform and look at a huge metal chute
Under this metal chute you can see massive gears and what might be considered an axle fulcrum that rolls back and forth
Pan up left and look at the reddish orange ball at the top of the track
Examine it closely to see that it looks like it is made of parts wood and part bluish green crystal
Now that should strike a memory bell
Remember those little scales in Saavedro's digs under the observatory where the elevator is in the garden house
This ball appears to have been deliberately fashioned of several different pieces
But you are not able to do much here yet
So just consider carefully the ball the track the chute and the sling just under the end of the chute
Before you go down in the elevator and you're standing inside it look down to find more of Saavedro's journal pages
Push the lever to go back down to the main level
At the bottom go to the right and out on the walkway
It hasn't changed much weather wise but you will not get drenched nor struck by lightening
Walk along the wooden bridges around the side of the building to a strange area of small sectioned ponds containing luminous green water
Keep going and go up on the little platform ahead
Pull that long vertical handle on the left
Up you go
Pull the handle on the right of the control panel to see a mind boggling scene
You will witness the top of the central control tower detach itself from the building hover in the air momentarily and hurdle a perfectly round ball of ice onto the tracks below
You can tell its ice because it shatters when it doesn't follow the correct path
Do this more than once because its great fun
And also so you can see how the orangish ball interacts with the ice ball to balance the metal chute as the ice ball attempts to pass through the chute
Why is the ice ball shattered
Well there's the rub
The metal chute doesn't go down far enough on the left end to let the ice ball pass through the chute and onto the tracks unharmed
You can move the three center levers to position the fulcrum axle in three different spots
Experiment with the levers and the ice ball to see what difference the positioning makes Then look up very closely at the orangish balance ball on the right Now you can see nothing but wooden sections right
We already know that one crystal ball is the same weight as four wooden balls
And metal ball is the same weight as crystal balls
So the crystal part of the balance ball weighs identically with four wooden parts
The balance ball has seven wood pieces and one crystal piece
So the crystal weighs the same as pieces of wood see wood equivalent weight crystal totals
Although fashioned of different materials it carries the weight required for the task and it is perfectly round think about this
For example A ball made entirely of wood would be too light
A ball made entirely of crystal would be too heavy
Well enough of all that right now
I have a headache Let's go do something helpful Use the long lever on the left to descend to the ground
When you arrive turn left and continue along the edge of the green pond area to the small building with the purple roof
When you get to the entry of the little building go inside through the double sliding doors and swing left Go forward to view the weighing and cutting room where the balls are fashioned for the counterweight mechanism However Saavedro has been in here too the scoundrel There are fragments of wood metal and crystal scattered on the floor beneath the counterweight The Weight and Fulcrum Puzzle In order to balance the metal chute properly you will need to move the axle fulcrum and you will need twice the weight of the balance ball for the counterweight The ball that is already begun is half wood So that is wood right You need total weight So add two more wood wedges just click and drag and one metal wedge You can tell metal from wood by the rings in the wood wedges And the metal wedges are darker
When you move the two wood and one metal wedges over to the counterweight you will not have a round ball But you have established the necessary weight required
Go back out to the control pedestal Use the lever to raise it Position the axle fulcrum at the left most position and pull the lever on the right side If your calculations are correct the new ice ball will successfully make its way down the track over the metal chute down the track on the other side and back to the tower intact You'll see a cut scene of a bridge being raised up on that interesting little off shore structure you couldn't reach back at the beginning of Amateria
Also the two doors that descend to cover the control panel have the code you need for the hexagonal puzzle controlling the bridges to the central tower Be sure to carefully record the code pattern on the top of the panel and note the border color is yellow X XXX X X X Go back down from the control tower here and right down the walkway over the water and back into the stone building Go right and forward up the steps to the second level Go back outside across the two bridges and turn left at the central tower Go forward once Turn left
Use the code you just received when you solved the Weight and Fulcrum Puzzle to press the buttons in the hexagonal box
If you got it right when you leave the close up the first section of the bridge to the central tower will snap into place But wait you can only go across one of three gaps There are two more code boxes and obviously two more puzzles to solve
That was just a test of your ability to record the codes We have a bit more exploring and work to do before we can enter the central building
Go back to the stone building You will notice that when you start to leave the area that the bridge snaps open again In the stone building go down the stairs and back to the right at the fork
Go past the elevator
Keep going down the tunnel with the brilliant blue lit rocks
You will enter a quiet pool area inside a cave like room with another bizarre painting of Sirrus and Achenar by Saavedro complete with an elevated platform for him to work from Keep going out of this room and into the area beyond that looks like the burned skeleton of a ship or maybe a whale
Go on through jumping from one outcropping to the next until you can climb up to the track bearing left The Sonic Ring Puzzle Walk through the pagoda shaped terminal there and out to a big hairpin curve in the track Wow There's a huge vibrating circle here Its a sonic field of some kind Don't go through it yet Go straight ahead to the ramp off to the side Turn right to see a little control switch Go in close Turn the hand to the o'clock position
Notice the difference in the sound of the vibration from the sonic ring
Note In order to successfully solve the puzzle the sonic rings must be set in sequential order no matter which ring you start with
Go back and walk right through the field inside the ring
Cool Go down through that little tunnel under the terminal ahead of you Follow it up the curving track to the next sonic ring Go through it this time
Turn around to see another switch
Set this one for o'clock Step back through the ring and follow the track up through another terminal It's another hair pin curve Go out to the ramp on the left past the sonic ring to the switch on the post Set this one to the o'clock position
Go back through the ring down to the lower tunnel Stop inside You will see three exits Go through the one in the middle Go on up the curving track to the fourth sonic ring Go through it and right on the ramp for access to the switch Set this one to o'clock Then go along the track upward and through to the top terminal and on to the last sonic ring Go to the ramp find the switch and set it for o'clock You will note that it is very quiet now Go back right and back up the track the way you came to the terminal Stop in the middle and turn left to view the central building Turn back
Go forward twice and then go down right across the black skeletal remnants and into the pool area where Saavedro's painting is
Go through the area and just outside turn left and go up the ladder on the side of the wall Go along the track to the control platform on the left Pull that tall handle to the extreme left to raise the platform
Pull the lever at the left to release another ice ball You will enjoy seeing the ball pass gracefully through the sonic ring track without being shattered
Note As the controller with its blue lights goes through its cycle it momentarily turns each sonic ring off according to the sequence in which you have set the switches So the ring that is set in the o'clock position turns off momentarily then the one in the o'clock position etc
This allows the ice ball to pass through them one at a time unharmed
Afterward you will see a cutscene of another bridge piece rising out there on that off shore structure And when the doors close on the control panel you will see that there's a new pattern embossed there and it has a lovely blue border Are you recording it XX X X XX X Turn left and use the lever to come back down Turn and go back up where the ladder awaits your return Go back through the pool area across the skeleton and up again on the tracks Go left to the terminal
Stand in the center and go extreme right Keep following the track until you must stop over a pool of hexagonal basins Very cool Step on the moss covered pillars and go along until you see a gate made of sticks on your left Pop in there and find another control platform Use the lever at left to go to the top The Pagoda Pinball Puzzle Your assignment here should you choose to accept it is to set up a pattern so the ice ball ends up at the right side of the wheel out there in the top left available position The wheel must land in a ring that has a bottom or it will fall right through into the sea
Use the red pegs on the holes in the two wheel controls to establish the correct pattern Note that one of the pegs is broken off in one of the holes on the left wheel Wonder who did that
Try this a few times for practice to see how the mechanism works
Pull the lever below the wheels horizontally to the right to literally get the ball rolling
Solution Left WheelPlace two of the red pegs in the o'clock just right of the broken peg and o'clock positions
Right WheelPlace the last peg in the o'clock position When you are successful you will see the ice ball enter the central building as did the others and another last bridge to the off shore structure is complete
Look at the top of the now closed panel Record the code on the top for the third bridge at the hexagonal boxes X X X X X X X Note that the border around this puzzle is green
Again make sure you have recorded the hexagon codes on the top of the control panel doors and the corresponding colors
Use the tall left lever to descend Turn left before you exit the gate Pick up more of Saavedro's journal pages and read them before going on out the gate
Go back right across the mossy pillars and up on the tracks
Go right through the sonic ring Go to the terminal and turn extreme left to face the central building
Go forward and turn right to climb down onto the black skeleton Go through the pool area and down the blue lighted tunnel Go up the stairs left at the fork and out of the building Go out the door and across both bridges Turn left
Go forward
Turn left to face the final push to solve the The Central Tower Bridge Puzzle Key in the first panel code yellow border from the Weight and Fulcrum Puzzle
Go across the first bridge Turn left and input the blue border code from the Sonic Ring Puzzle Go across the second bridge
Turn left and input the green border code from the Pagoda Pinball Puzzle
If you are correct you will be able to open the round door on the central tower Step inside to be impressed with the sudden appearance of a mechanically operated stairway
Go up the stairs and look down to see the four doors providing passage for the iceballs through the tower Walk forward and click on the purple suspended chair below to gain access to the viewer Be patient through another sad monolog from Saavedro When he is finished are you ready for this
reach up and pull the lever above your head
You are in the ice ball's position But you are in no peril You have one more puzzle to solve up here When the puzzle positions itself in front of you look up over your head to see four lights that denote the color route of four puzzles three of which you have completed as follows Yellow Weight and Fulcrum PuzzleBlue Sonic Ring PuzzleGreen Pagoda Pinball PuzzleRed Offshore Structure The object of this dandy little puzzle is to send an ice ball through all the puzzle configurations that you have already established If you solve the puzzle the three bridges you saw in cutscenes after you solved the yellow blue and green puzzles will rise from the water and remain stationary at the appropriate critical moment When the bridges are stabilized you will be able to get to the Off shore Structure red The Central Tower Turntable Puzzle Okay let's go for it
Click on the control panel for a close up Number the circular buttons from top left to bottom right Look at the red yellow blue and green indicator on the sides of the panel
That shows where the ice balls start and exit the tracks You need to establish a path out to the red off shore structure Starting with track button number two top middle you must build a route from the entrance to the red structure backwards to the exit point of the other colors When you get it right the ice ball can roll from blue through yellow through green to red When you think you have it all set up push the blue button in the tower over your head
Try it a few times try it many times You can do it
If you get frustrated here is the solution Click onceClick onceClick onceClick twice middle Click onceClick oncePress the blue button up top side You are about to find yourself inside an ice ball Is this incredible or what You personally make the jaw dropping awesome trip around the entire array of tracks in Amateria It's worth every second of hair pulling puzzle annoyance you have been through so far See the beautiful Dynamic Forces symbol unfold before you when you ultimately arrive at the off shore structure in the red zone
Pan down to access the J'nanin linking book and you'll find yourself back in the observatory there You know just what to do
Take the Dynamic Forces symbol and place it on the viewer You will see the cage appear below you and this time something different a little bridge to the open cage Atrus will speak to you again in a cut scene as though he were bidding Sirrus and Achenar farewell on their first trip to Narayan
Go down across the little bridge to the cage and click on the Narayan linking book Click on the picture to realize almost instantly that the last great segment of your EXILE sojourn will begin under water Chapter Six Narayan The Balance Age You are facing a set of stairs Before going up the stairs turn right and examine the words and symbols something about the symbols is very familiar on the red tapestries Also notice a maze of what likely is electrical conduit all over the floor in huge looping circles
It looks more like tree roots
Go back to and up the stairs Try the little metal hatch on a pedestal to your left What is that It won't open Go left and then turn right to examine the blue bubble in a lighted doorway
This is some kind of force field and it's activated
Turn left go forward and try the round hatch on a pedestal Nothing will happen here either Turn right and go forward again to stand in front of a gate where you can see a large gondola suspended from an overhead cable You can't open the gate either You don't suppose there is a power shortage in Narayan too
Turn right and go up the metal stairway you can see off in the left corner As you turn and step forward toward the tower Saavedro will emerge Yikes Has he now gone so totally bonkers that he is dressing in the tapestries
He's very angry that you aren't Atrus that's for sure Next he is chastising himself for being so stupid He's left the J'nanin linking book behind too and he goes on to tell you that you are stuck here for eternity However he says that if you are lucky enough to figure out a way out of Narayan be careful about the linking books because the doors they open don't close behind you
Look down You are standing on a power generator That's pretty obvious Now pan around until you see the controls with a now familiar red handle Turn it once to hear the generator power up Nice sound
That was simple enough
Not like the Voltaic Age for sure
You can examine other areas up here
Is that a huge species of marine plant towering above the platform Maybe that's part of a Lattice Tree that Saavedro talks about in his journal It might make you think that all the strange looking conduit might really be Lattice Tree roots Pan right of the tower to see the beginning of the gondola route
Go back down the stairs and over to the switching pedestal that stands between the other two that have opening hatches Follow the conduit to the right Go over there and open that hatch Interesting pattern there but no action yet Leave the hatch Go back to the center and turn the switching lever to the left Walk over to the left hatch Open it Note that it has three active circles one for each age you visited where you found the appropriate symbol The Age Symbols Puzzle The Age Symbols Puzzle The symbols you have in inventory are Energy Voltaic AgeNature EdannaDynamic Forces Amateria Now go look at those tapestries Compare the signs on the symbols that you got from each of the three ages Find the words that correspond with each sign Here's the problem Saavedro has not revealed the entire set of four signs words for each of the three symbols You only have two signs words Parts of each one are missing Or in other words two signs are missing on each of the three ages symbols The signs are all in Atrus' journal as an integral part of his long monolog on the premise behind the creation of each age
From Atrus' journal four signs words each age Edanna
Nature
Encourages
Mutual
DependenceVoltaic
Energy
Powers
Future
MotionAmateria
Dynamic
Forces
Spur
Change With the information you have you can complete the entire symbol for each age in accordance with the three wheels inside the puzzle You need four signs for each of the three wheels The signs you have remember only supply two of the four needed
Starting with Edanna You have the signs forNATUREandENCOURAGE
You need two more words MUTUALandDEPENDENCE Find those two words and carefully copy the sign for each word
For Voltaic You have the signs forFUTUREandMOTION Find and carefully draw the signs forENERGYandPOWER
For Amateria You have the signs forFORCEandCHANGE Find and draw the signs forDYNAMICandSPUR
Note To make this easier You might want to sketch in order all four signs for each of the three ages in the exact word sequence from Atrus' journal shown above
Now go back to the hatch and attack that puzzle You can complete each of the three symbols in any order Put the first word in the upper circle of each wheel and work clockwise
I started with Edanna at the top circle Input clockwise the signs for Nature Encourage Mutual and Dependence around the circle to complete the requirements for that age symbol
Below right input clockwise the Voltaic symbol with the signs for Energy Power Future and Motion
Below left input clockwise the Amateria symbol with the signs for Dynamic Forces Spur and Change
As you complete the four signs within each wheel the symbol will light up When you complete all three wheels correctly the hatch will close and the force field off to the left will be shut down
Okay you have established the power to the force field on the left side for the switching lever But what about the gate
Don't leave the room yet Go over to the switching lever and pull it to the right Go back to the hatch at the far right of the room
Open it and note that you now have power
But wait what to input here Oh yes Remember there was a fourth premise in Atrus journal that we haven't used yet for a fourth age Balance d System s Stimulate Civilization We have four more words to find and four more signs to decipher Leave the puzzle Go back and take a look at the tapestries again
Find the wordCIVILIZATIONand draw its sign
On looking further for the words Balance Systems and Stimulate you will find they are not there Go back to the switching lever and pull it to the left Turn around and exit the room where the force field has again disappeared Go left and down the stairs to find more tapestries Find the wordSYSTEM S and record its sign
Find the wordBALANCE D and record its sign
And lastly find the wordSTIMULATEand record its sign
You have them all now Return up the stairs to the main level Pull the switching lever to the right again Go to the little hatch and input the signs in clockwise sequence from the top Balance System Stimulate Civilization
You will see a disturbing cutscene where you are given an ultimatum by the devious Saavedro
As soon as he is finished with you SAVE YOUR GAME IMMEDIATELY End Game Scenarios Well you could be finished here in Narayan You have turned on all the power
And your ticket home Tomahna is the linking book sitting right downstairs on the podium However you need the Releeshan linking book Saavedro stole in the first place You don't want him left here with an opportunity to reach Tomahna
And you don't want to go back to Atrus and Catherine empty handed do you Remember what Saavedro said about the doors being left open behind you What about his potential access to Atrus Catherine and baby Yeesha

You can immediately pull the switching lever If you do this Saavedro will prove himself to be the lying lout that he has been so far He will toss the Releeshan book away into limbo jump into the gondola and take off This leaves you stranded till infinity and beyond

You can follow him out to the gondola area where he waits But if you are out there too long Saavedro will drop the Releeshan book and go after you
If you go out again you will get the same reaction but no hammer this time
If you try a third time Look out immediately

Here's the best scenario Run upstairs and throw the power switch on the main generator Both of the force fields gate too will close trapping Saavedro outside of the control room
Come back down the stairs Face Saavedro through the gate He'll finally give the Releeshan book back to you trying to bargain for his freedom Is he pathetic or what He can't go anywhere without power and he can't come back in the control room
Here's your chance Turn around and set the switching lever to the right Of course it won't do anything yet because the main power is shut off Go quickly back up the stairs and turn the generator back on This will activate the gondola and a grateful happily waving Saavedro will bid you adieu hop in the gondola and return to Narayan's Lattice Tree where he now knows they are alive including his beloved family
After he sails away go back down the stairs turn the switching lever to the left to open the force field Go out through the left exit down the stairs to the Tomahna linking book Click on it It will transfer into your inventory
Click on it to bring it up open it and return to a relieved and happy Catherine and Atrus as they receive from you the precious Releeshan linking book
So it is said All's well that end's well

This document is a special help file designed to clarify just a few of the more difficult nagging problems people commonly have with Myst III Exile
It is not a walkthrough in any sense nor is it a spoiler file
The intention is to help those players who want something in between when they are just plain stuck
For a comprehensive detailed walkthrough pleaseClick Here
Voltaic age The Lava Room ControllerThe Circuit Cylinder Edanna Finding the Route to the Spore Pod Plants When you are downstairs in the lava room the object is to turn on the compressor fan
You are standing on a platform that has three positions Low Middle and High
Use the control knob to raise the platform once
Then pass the knob through the center slot to transfer the gear to the right side
Rotate the control knob again to raise the platform to the highest level where you can access the fan switch
After turning on the fan lower the platform once change the gear to the left lower the platform all the way and go to the upstairs controller
Raise the platform to reintroduce the lava and make hot compressed air
Be sure you have finished with the control gear in the left hand position between the platform and the large gear
It is possible to get the platform to the lowest position with the gear on the right and when you raise the platform with the upstairs controller it wouldn't turn the large gear and let in the lava
No hor air would result
By the way the same technique is correct for many other items the four marbles in the linking book locks that have to be set to o'clock etc
are best handled this same way
Click on them andrelease the mouse button It is very much easier to control their position when you are not also gripping the button
The Lift lever at the steam valves works the same way
Click release drag right for up or left for down and click again
The circuit cylinder only needs one circuit board to be set correctly
Go to any one and click ONLY on the right side buttons
Twice on the top five times on the bottom and once on the middle
Here's a picture of the completed circuit
The reason I am recommending doing the top and bottom portion first is so that you can see when they are correct
Then one more click on the middle will finish it
Having trouble finding that alternate path in the hollow log
It's about halfway through the log on the right as you're going back down and not easy to see
It almost looks as though Saavedro carved his initials on the log you must crawl through
Step through to go find the quot bloomin' onions quot This document may only be distributed with the express written permission of the author Tally HoThe content of this document may not be altered in any way without the permission of the author Any proposed changes or additions to the walkthrough may be submitted toTally Ho

Chapter Tomahna by Day Part You start your adventure in a gondola with Yeesha the daughter of Atrus and Catherine
Hang on and join the ride
When you arrive in front of the landing platform Yeesha will stop the gondola to enjoy the view
She tells you to make a picture of the nice view
She warns you not to place your finger in front of the lens because her father does that and always ruins his pictures that way
To take a picture click on your right mouse button
Then move the cursor to the photo camera at the bottom left side of your screen
Make sure you have the landing platform in your viewer and then press the left mouse button for your first picture
Nice view
When you reach the landing platform wait until Yeesha enters the building to tell her father that you have arrived
While you are standing in front of the door look to the right and pull the lever attached to the railing
Enter the opened door
Climb up the stairs to your right
Look to the right and you'll see a small type of planetarium standing on the desk
Move the lever at the bottom of the device to turn the planets
Open the drawer of the desk
Examine the drawer
Hmmm nothing
Zoom out and close the drawer
Turn to left and move one step forward
Turn to the right and open middle drawer of the desk
Also examine this drawer to find nothing again
Open the small cupboard with the small squares at the left side on top of the desk
Zoom in
Hmmm nothing except little empty flasks Zoom out
Turn to the left and go one step forward
The father of Yeesha good old Atrus now welcomes you
Listen to his story
It seems that he has build a new device called a Crystal Viewer to get linked to the different Ages
Atrus is absolutely sure that the Crystal Viewer will work properly
The only thing is it must be calibrated first
It would be good if you would help him with that
He points to the control panel behind your back
If you zoom in on the panel you'll see that the control panel has a slider and three dials
With those three dials from the left to the right you can adjust the amplitude the frequency and the phase by turning the dials
First of all save your game just in case of something goes wrong
Tip if you don't want to calibrate this device or if you can't just zoom out from the device twice during the process
Atrus tells you it really isn't that hard
But the final result will be the same namely that the Crystal Viewer will explode anyhow
If you want to calibrate the device follow Atrus' instructions
For a large part I can help you with that
The last part however is a little tricky
To accomplish the last part you must listen very carefully to the instructions of Atrus
Each time he tells that you must choose another signal you must move the slider
The first set of coordinates is for Achenar's Prison Age called Haven
Here we go move the slider to the rightturn the left dial all the way to the rightturn the right dial all the way to the rightmove the slider to leftturn the left dial all the way to the rightturn center dial all the way to the right That's it
The first set of coordinates for Haven has been set
Now the second set for the Prison World of Sirrus called Spire move the slider to the rightturn the left dial to degrees to the rightturn the center dial to degrees to the rightturn the right dial to degrees to the rightmove the slider to the leftturn the left dial to degrees to the rightturn the right dial up to degrees to the rightturn the center dial a little to the right For the last part you make very small adjustments
So follow Atrus'instructions very carefully until you have set the second coordinates
I can only wish you good luck with that
When the calibration has been done the happiness is however of very short duration
Something seems to be very wrong with the Crystal Viewer and as a result the Crystal Viewer breaks down Atrus leaves for Rime to find some materials to fix the Crystal Viewer
In the meantime you only have to restore the power supply and you have to get the Crystal Viewer to work properly again to get in touch with him
He also tells you not to forget to slide out the antenna on the roof
The last thing he kindly asks you is to keep an eye on Yeesha
And off he goes leaving you a little helpless and bewildered behind
The first thing what we'll do is to restore the power supply
Turn around and take one step into the direction of the broken Crystal Viewer
Turn to the left and you'll see an elevator door beneath a little stair
Pull the lever at your right to open the elevator door
Enter the elevator and wait until the door is closed
Look around and move the handle with the red lights to the center position
When the elevator has arrived at it's destination pull up the beige lever at the right side of the elevator door and exit the elevator
Remember that you can find the elevator here
Turn to the right and follow the wooden planks until you are standing in the first greenhouse
Turn to the left and go further along the wall of the greenhouse
When you stop turn to the right and go through the opening in the wall
A little further Yeesha is standing in the entrance of the next greenhouse and calls that you must come quickly
So quickly walk to her
When in that greenhouse go to the right and Yeesha will show you a green colored gecko
When Yeesha leaves turn around and walk further into the greenhouse
When you stop turn to the right and go through the next opening in the wall of the greenhouse
The green gecko
Walk straight on to the wooden planks that are leading into a rock formation in the distance
Walk further until you enter the rock formation
Examine the room and you'll see a huge water wheel that has stopped due to the little accident with the Crystal Viewer resulting in no power for the moment
In front of you you'll see a pole with a button on top two orange blinking symbols and below them a large lever
First take a picture of the orange blinking symbols
After that pull the large lever to reset the device
Notice that the two orange symbols will no longer be lit
Turn around and exit the rock formation
Walk straight ahead into the greenhouse
Exit the greenhouse through the next opening in the wall
Look to the left and see that Yeesha is standing in her mother Catherine's garden chamber
Enter that garden chamber
Yeesha will tell you that there is something wrong with the power box
Catherine made that power box because Atrus has caused accidents with the power supply in the past
Walk into the direction of the power box
Yeesha is showing you some captured fireflies
When she disappears zoom in on the power box and pull up the shutter
At the back of the power box you'll see six panels of which only two are lit and have the same kind of symbol at the bottom you saw earlier in the rock formation with the water wheel
You will also see two rows of buttons that look very much like the buttons of an old fashioned typing machine
To the left you'll see a lever and to the right a large push button
The power box before With the lever to the left you can reset the device and the push button
To the right is some kind of enter button with which you have to confirm your entries
With the back row of buttons you can send power and with the front row of buttons you can receive power
To send power to the rock with the water wheel you have to push the next buttons from the left to the right back row front row enterback row front row enterback row front row enterback row front row enterback row front row enter and afterwards When you have done this correctly the symbols of the water wheel will blink and the power box will close
If this doesn't happen you have done something wrong
In that case you have to pull the left lever to reset the device and try again
Turn around and zoom in on the book on the table
Zoom out and zoom in on the microscope on the table
Zoom out
Turn to the right and leave the garden chamber
When you step outside you hear the sound of someone playing a flute somewhere from the left
Turn to the left and enter the greenhouse
Notice that the sound of the flute gets louder
Walk further through the greenhouse until you reach the bucket filled with water
Turn to the left and climb down the ladder
Now you have another meeting with Yeesha
She is practicing playing a song on a shell
When you have seen and heard enough climb up the ladder
Turn to the right and walk further through the greenhouse
Exit the greenhouse and walk straight on into the other greenhouse
Yeesha playing the flute Walk further to the left side
Go through the opening in the wall
Walk straight on the wooden planks that lead to the rock formation
Enter through the opening in the rock to end up once more in the room with the water wheel
Notice that the two symbols are lit white now which means that there is power
Push the button above the symbols and the water wheel will start to move
Congratulations you have just restored the power
Turn around and go to outside
Walk forward on the wooden planks
In the distance you'll see Yeesha walking to the right
Unfortunately something else has gone very wrong now
With a thundering noise the walking planks collapse leaving you behind in the water
For the moment you have no idea what caused the explosion but you find out soon enough
Notice the green glow caused by the explosion Tomahna by Night Part Climb out of the water via the blue lit planks
Walk all the way back to the elevator via the two greenhouses
Pull the lever and step into the elevator
Move the handle with the red lights into the upper position to return to Atrus' study
Now it's time to accomplish the next task to get in touch with Atrus
Open the elevator
Walk to the panel that you used at the beginning to establish the amplitude frequency and phase with Atrus
No you don't have to do that again
Open the upper drawer at the right of the round desk
Look through Atrus' diary that is lying in the drawer
Approximately in the middle of the diary you'll see an image of five colored crystals
Make a picture of these crystals
It's the crystal combination for Rime the place Atrus has left for
Atrus' Journal Turn to the left and walk toward the Crystal Viewer
Climb up the little stairs at the left side and walk to the three circular guarding monitors
Zoom in on the monitors
Zoom out and look to the right and you'll see a large drawing of Tomahna
Flip over the first drawing and you'll see a sketch of a telescope
Turn to the right a little and you'll find a switch that is difficult to see
It is in the direction of the elevator
The very hard to see switch That's it
Walk to that switch and press the switch all the way down That will open a part of the roof
Seems like a good idea to me to use the telescope
Turn around and walk back to the guarding monitors
At the left of it climb up the little stairs
Turn to the left and below you'll see a little chair
Take a seat and push the red blinking button to go up in the direction of the telescope
Zoom in on the telescope and press the upper right button that has on it an image of a lighthouse
The button is now lit orange and more importantly now the antenna on the roof will slide out
Turn the wheel to the right to get a complete picture of the moon
Zoom out and press the red button on your chair to go down
Turn around and step on the platform
Turn to the right and walk toward the Crystal Viewer
Notice that all the crystals are burning now on top of the device
It should work properly now
Zoom in on the Crystal Viewer
Your goal now is to get in touch with Atrus
First of all save your game
You never know when something will go wrong
Now have a look at your Journal
That is the device at the bottom leftof your screen next to the photo camera
Take a look at the picture of the crystals you just took in Atrus' diary
Zoom in on that picture and make a sketch of those crystals and note the colors of each and every crystal
You can also refer to the photo before setting each crystal eliminating the need to sketch them
Now have a closer look the Crystal Viewer
At the top you see a display that now only shows snow
Beneath the display you'll notice five sliding lids with buttons underneath them
At the right side you see a circular panel with colored dots a little lever above the dots and a slider above the colored dots
Note that the little lever is situated over the red dot
That's fine because that is the color you have to start with
Move the slider on the circular panel to the right and see that another form of a crystal will be projected on the circular panel while sliding the slider
Be sure that you move the slider all the way back to the left
Now move the slider slowly to the right and be sure that you see the sixth image of a crystal
Then press the left button underneath the display
This opens the lid and you'll see that the same shaped red colored crystal is now in that box
Now move the little lever over the pale blue dot
Be sure that you move the slider all the way back to the left
Now move the slider slowly to the right and be sure that you see the third image of a crystal
Then press the second button underneath the display
This opens the lid and you'll see that the same shaped pale blue colored crystal is now in that box
Now move the little lever over the yellow dot
Move the slider all the way to the right this time Then press the third button underneath the display
This opens the lid and you'll see that the same shaped yellow colored crystal is now in that box
Now move the little lever over the green dot
Don't move the slider this time
Then press the fourth button underneath the display
This opens the lid and you'll see that the same shaped green colored crystal is now in that box
Now move the little lever over the dark blue dot
Be sure that you move the slider all the way back to the left
Now move the slider slowly to the right and be sure that you see the second image of a crystal
Then press the fifth button underneath the display
This opens the lid and you'll see that the same shaped dark blue colored crystal is now in that box which makes the series complete
Now press the large button beneath the five small buttons
If you did this correctly you'll be in touch with Atrus
If not you have done something wrong
In that case give it another try until you succeed Well done
Atrus seems to be stuck in an electromagnetic storm
You can barely here him tell you to go to his bedroom and to press the button on his desk to discover his studies about the Ages Haven and Spire
He also asks you to tell Yeesha that she must not forget to do her homework
If you want to hear the message again just push the large button again

I'll bet you'll never taken that many
On the other hand you can always delete pictures if you want
That's one of the benefits of digital cameras Zoom in on the blue book
Page through the book to learn more about the Age called Haven the Prison Age of Atrus' son Achenar
Also take a picture of these colored crystals

Walk further to the left and stand in front of the bookcase
Zoom in on the glass doors beneath the books
In the left cupboard you'll see some kind of book and in the right cupboard you'll see some kind of cloth
There is no way to open these cupboards
Now have a look at the books
Notice a lot of books with D'Ni language on the backs as mentioned in Yeesha's diary
Remember that she wrote that she doesn't forget anybody's age
Now there are two different ways to discover the way in which the names Yeesha Sirrus Archenar Catherine and Atrus are written in D'Ni language
One way is by returning to the garden where you can find the family tree in one of the greenhouses
The other way is by using the picture you just made of the opened book with D'Ni signs and the corresponding characters
Also remember you saw earlier on Catherine's note how her name and Atrus'name are written in D'Ni language
This last way doesn't need any further explanation I guess
If you happen to choose the first way here is how you can find that family tree
And not only that but I'll also point out the various spots where you can use the amulet to see what happened in the past

D Walkthrough Hello
Coelho Buda here or for those familiar with the Guild of Greeters Rabbit
Myst IV Revelation marks the return to the node system which meansyou haven't the freedom of movement that is available in a true Denvironment but each node can behave like it was D
If you have playedExile this system is just like the one used there As always and as in my previous walkthroughs any contributions will be gladlyaccepted and can be sent to my e mail Warning This walkthrough contains major spoilers
It could seriously affectyour enjoyment of the game
I do not give out hints or nudges
I simply statehow a given puzzle should be solved
That said read on at your own risk So without further ado on to the game itself
Tomahna The game begins with you inside a tram with a cute little girl
This isYeesha
Listen to her speech and enjoy the tram ride
When you are close tothe end the tram will halt and Yeesha will tell you to take a picture ofTomahna the Age you are in to remember it when you are gone
This is a wayfor the game to tell you that you can take picture shots of the environmentwhich will be very helpful throughout the game To take a picture click on the imager icon leftmost icon on the bottom bar This will make the game toggle to camera mode
Click the left mouse button totake a picture and the right mouse button to close the camera mode
While incamera mode you can move the screen around to select what you want tophotograph
Once you are done enjoy the rest of the ride
When it ends Yeesha will leave you alone outside of the Observatory Day Once you have full control of your character look around you
The game hasbeautiful graphics
Watch the pretty birds fly by
Before proceeding look tothe left and down near where you exit the tram
There's a button to call thetram and below it a symbol
Get a close up of the symbol below the lever andtake an imager shot to refer to it later Continue forward and pull the lever on the right to open the door to theObservatory
Enter it
Go up the small flight of stairs to the right
Thisroom has a lot to be discovered
Some of the items that can be found hereinclude an orrery several operable drawers with writing materials crystalsand bottles and also small cabinets Continue forward to trigger a sequence of Atrus explaining why he brought youhere
It will trigger the first puzzle and your first choice you can chooseto follow Atrus instructions and solve the puzzle or do nothing
The endresult will be the same the Viewer will overload causing a short circuit tothe entire Age To solve the puzzle you'll need to overlap a wave sign over one provided byAtrus in the machine behind you
This is done by manipulating two signals ared and a green
The slider on top selects the signal and the knobs belowalter the signals amplitude how high or low it sounds frequency how fastor slow it cycles and phase how ahead or behind relatively to the patternsignal You will need to do this for the two prison Ages Haven and Spire
It'srelatively easy if you follow the instructions Atrus gives out
If you find ittoo hard as I said above you can always choose not to do it Once you're done there will be a small explosion and Atrus will go off toRime another Age to find some materials to repair the viewer
He will leaveyou with a list of things to do while he's gone so you'll have your work cutout for you here in Tomahna
So here is what you need to do Restore full power to the Age by closing the gates at the water facility Look up the combination for Rime in Atrus journal so you can contact himlater Turn on the roof antenna Keep an eye on YeeshaLet's start with the journal which is in a drawer next to the calibrationmachine
Pull the drawer out to open it close up on the journal and pull thecover to the left to open it
Read the journal
Make a note or take apicture of the colored crystal code for Rime
I'll put it here in terms ofcolors and slider positions you will need to select when the time comes andexplain what this means when you get to the Viewer Rime code Red Cyan Yellow Green Blue Walk to the other side of the room
In the middle you will find a stairleading to an elevator
Get a close up on the lever that opens the elevatorand take a picture of the symbol below Continue past the viewer and climb up a small flight of stairs
There arethree security cameras here not working because there's no power and twomaps on the wall to the right
The first one maps out Tomahna and the onebelow is a sketch for the Telescope
Continuing forward will lead you to theTelescope chair
The chair has a button that makes it transport you up towhere you can turn on the antenna
As the power is still out there is no wayof getting there now
Return to the elevator and pull the lever Enter the elevator
Fortunately there's enough power to operate it to themiddle level
When the ride finishes use the lever on the right to open thedoor and exit
Proceed along the walkway to the first conservatory
There's aladder leading down to the bottom of it
Climb down and take a picture ofAtrus' Family Tree written in D'ni
The lamp in the middle is not workingbecause there's no power
Return upstairs cross to the other side and exitthe conservatory
Yeesha will beckon you from the other conservatory to comesee something Before going to her you can step into the Botany Lab and explore
To theright of the entrance there are some pressurized chambers
There is a symbolon the wall of the closest one to the entrance
Take a picture of it
On thetable in the middle there is a book with diagrams of butterflies and amicroscope that shows a close up of a leaf Opposite the pressure chambers there's a small cabinet with venetian lid Open it to reveal a power box
Notice all the glowing symbols bellow thecolumns
Each corresponds to a place in Tomahna and you have been pictures ofthem so now you know at least what three of those columns refer to
There aretwo symbols glowing red
These are the ones that correspond to the gates atthe water plant
For now leave the power box Continue exploring the lab
You will find some beetles within a glass case You have another choice here
You can leave the case alone or open it
Thiswill affect the way Yeesha reacts to you a little later on when you returnhere
If you set them free she will be upset with you
If you leave it as isshe will comment on her experiment and that she has to report the results toher father Past the fireflies there is a door at the back
It is closed and will remainso until you can open it from the other side
To the right of the door thereis a workbench
On a drawer you will find Catherine's Journal
Read it to findout more about what is going on
Further to the right it's possible to openone of the chambers to see one of Catherine's flowers up close When done exit the Botany Lab and continue to the second conservatory
Yeeshawill show you a salamander and talk about her necklace Serenia another Age and her two brothers
That necklace will be very important throughout thegame
For now exit the second conservatory There's a fork here
The left path leads to Atrus and Catherine's bedroom andthe right path leads to the water plant
Take the left path to the bedroom This is one of the few opportunities you'll have to explore the bedroom by day although you will not be able to do much there as there is no power yet
Before you enter notice the plaque on the floor outside the entrance
Closeup on it to see something from Uru The walkway continues to another platform on the left with two levers
Again as the power is still out there is nothing to do here
This means that therest of the Age is off limits for now
Return to the bedroom and explore abit There is a note on the right bedside table take a picture a lamp on theleft bedside table a desk with a lamp and some drawers and a fireplace with apicture above it
Opening the central top drawer on the desk reveals a noteexplaining how to turn on the code panel inside the fireplace
As there's nopower you can't do that yet
Exit the bedroom and go to the water plant byreturning to the second conservatory and taking a right at the fork with yourback to the conservatory Climb down the stairs to the Gate controls
Notice the two glowing redsymbols
These are the same symbols as the ones in the power box
Although youdon't need to reset the gates by pulling the middle lever
Now return to theBotany Lab
You can use Zip mode if you want to rightmost icon on the bottomof the screen
To use Zip mode click on the lightning bolt icon and thenselect a destination from the little vignette strip When you arrive at the Botany Lab Yeesha will be there
Enter the Lab and shewill make fun about her father and tell you about the Power box
She'll tellyou that you need to have the green light on top of a column lit up to havethe power turned on to that section
She will also say that she isn't allowedto touch electrical things so it will be up to you to set things workingagain She will then proceed to the glass case with the beetles
Depending on whatyou did before when you take a step forward she will have a differentreaction
When she leaves go to the Power box Open it
Right now the observatory and the elevator have power
The redglowing symbols for the water gates are off you reset the lever at the waterplant
The panel in front of you has two rows of buttons and a switch on theleft side this acts as a reset for this puzzle
There is a button on theright that is used to transfer power
What you have to do now is transferenough power units from the working sections to the water gates so that youwill then be able to turn the generator for the whole Age back on Columns from left to right correspond to Observatory Living Quarters LeftWater Gate Right Water Gate Elevator and Botany Lab
The first row ofbuttons sets the column to transfer from and the second row of buttons setsthe column to transfer to
Select a button from the first row then select abutton from the second row and then hit the transfer button To activate the gates follow this sequence From column To column left gate turned on right gate turned onWhen you are done the gate symbols will glow cyan and the Power box lid willclose
Return to the water plant and the symbols should be glowing white
Takea moment to save because this is the last time you will be seeing Tomahna byday
Press the button on top of the controls to open the water gates
Thewater starts flowing powering the dynamo wheel and creating electricity Turn around and climb the stairs
At the top you will see Yeesha crossing thewalkway and waving to you
Go forward to trigger a sequence
An earthquakewill happen make that a Tomahnaquake you will fall down and be renderedunconscious
When you come to you'll be in Night Tomahna by night
Wow amazing and gorgeous
Pity that in coming to you'll bea little woozy hence the distortion on the field of vision
Maybe you bumpedyour head somewhere or those green fumes had something to do with it
Anyway climb up from here as this helps to clear the old noggin
You can only climbto the side of the Conservatory
If you make a detour to the Botany Lab andtake a peek at the Power box you'll see that the whole Age is powered now You can get to the bottom of the first Conservatory and turn on the lampthere
It can be tilted to light up the Family Tree and take a better look atit
Climb up exit the conservatory and proceed to the elevator
Return to theObservatory to check on Atrus Exit the elevator and turn right
Go to the security cameras you can get aclose up on them if you want to and see different parts of the Age area
Nowthat the power is on and it's dark you can see a lever with a light on thehandrail behind you
Pull the lever to open the roof of the Observatory Continue to the Telescope chair
Sit on it tilt around a bit and press thebutton
Once on top close up on the telescope
You can move it around usingthe two small wheels and get a look at the moon
All you need to do herethough is turn on the antenna by pressing the button with the windmill symbolon top of the right wheel Exit the close up press the red button and exit the chair
Return to theviewer in front of the elevator
Time to contact Atrus
Get a close up on theviewer console
You'll see five compartments with a button in front of eachone another button below these a monitor showing static a color wheelselector and a slider with nine positions being the first Each of the slider positions corresponds to a different crystal and each ofthe color wheel positions can be used to produce different color crystals Pressing a button in front of a compartment places the corresponding selectedcrystal there So to input the code for Rime do the following as in the sequence Imentioned earlier pressing the button in front of each compartment left toright after a crystal has been selected Place slider on slot initial position is color wheel stays on Red Place slider on slot and color wheel on Cyan Place slider on slot and color wheel on Yellow Place slider on slot and color wheel on Green Place slider on slot and color wheel on Blue Once you are done press the big button below the compartments to listen toAtrus
He can't leave Rime due to an electromagnetic storm
What he says nextis very important Go to his bedroom and press the button on the desk to discover hiscommentaries on Haven and Spire Tell Yeesha not to forget her homework OK so on to Atrus' bedroom
Exit the viewer and go to the elevator
Selectthe bottommost position
Enjoy the ride to the other side
As the walkway wasdestroyed during the quake the elevator is now the only way for crossing tothe other side
You'll arrive on the platform that was on the left of thebedroom
The switch on the end can now be operated to have a bridge switchfrom the Yeesha's bedroom to this platform with the pivot point being theKitchen area
For now let us examine the bedroom Go to the desk and turn on the lamp there
Open the topmost central drawer andpress the button button won't work if the drawer is closed that is below itto open a panel revealing two books one for Spire red and one for Haven blue
Besides some more background information you will find viewer codesfor both Ages which I reproduce below Spire code Green Blue Red Yellow Cyan Haven code Blue Red Purple Green Yellow Note you could now return to the Observatory and input the codes to see astatic image of each Age following the same method I explained for the Rimecode
However other than being pretty pictures these do not add any relevantinformation to the game other than showing a little more of the trickerySirrus is capable of which you'll learn later on
So I won't include it as amust do but mention it here so you can go there if you want to The viewer for Haven shows a shipwreck and the viewer for Spire shows somecrystal statues like the picture above the fireplace in the bedroom Go across the room and turn on the lamp on the bedside table
Then turnaround and go into the Fireplace
The game will take over and you will collectYeesha's Memory Amulet which will flash whenever a memory read clue ispresent at a given object or location like it's doing right now
Press theicon of the amulet to see a short movie of someone trying to grab Yeesha
Fornow do nothing inside the fireplace
Exit to the bedroom and take a lookaround with the amulet You'll get a reaction at the close up view of the painting and you can use iton both of the books
This will work as an audio book in the voice of theperson who wrote it
Exit and go to the plaque on the floor in front of thebedroom
Another reaction here Onwards to the Kitchen area
Go to the platform next to the bedroom an turnthe switch
The gangway will come to this platform
Cross to the other side Approach the table on the outside and get a close up on the book
Use theamulet
Take a picture of the book you'll be needing those translating skillsin a bit and notice the notepad on the right
Translating it you'll see it'sYeesha's name she's been practicing
Enter the Kitchen Explore around
There's a fireplace with picture's of the boys on the mantel to the right there's a picture of Atrus and Catherine and on the back you'llfind the food preparation area
The amulet reacts on the stove which can beoperated
Above the stove there's the symbol for this area no longer needed but nice to see consistency within a game
Behind you the water spout isalso working Continue to the front of the Kitchen to see Yeesha's picture on the right walland a chess set to which the amulet reacts
These pictures along with thefamily tree the D'ni alphabet book and something Yeesha will say are the keyto another puzzle you'll have to tackle later on
Exit this area and move thegangway
Notice that there's an area below the one you are about to go to Continue forward to Yeesha's bedroom
On the left there's a toy a table withballs pins and holes that can be tilted and a bookcase
On a close up youcan see a an Age book and a paper with the print of an hand
The books on topall have names written in D'ni and five of them can be pushed at a time This is the puzzle I was referring to above but it is still too early tosolve it On the writing desk you'll find a crystal sculpture to which the amuletreacts
There's also an orrery above the desk
To the right of the desk isYeesha's bed and a dress to which the amulet also reacts
Finally there's anaquarium on stand near the door
Exit the room and return to the platform withthe elevator
Use Zip mode if you want to Note optionally if you want to see some more amulet reactions here's a listof places where you will get them Below first conservatory Family Tree pictureBotany Lab flower inside pressure chamber Catherine's Journal Power BoxObservatory outside symbol for Observatory below tram call leverObservatory inside Atrus' Journal Viewer console Security cameras Telescope Again as with the Viewer codes for Haven Spire and Serenia when you get it these are not crucial to finishing the game but they sure add to theatmosphere Enter the bedroom and go to the fireplace
Close the panel by pressing thebutton in front of you
The objective of this puzzle is to light up the tileswhere the lasers are pointing to
Tricky part is that when you press a button it lights up four buttons above below right and left
Here's a diagram ofwhat has to be lit and another one of the order and which buttons to press soas to light the correct tiles OXOOOOOOXOXOOXOOOXXXXOXOXXXXXXOXOXXXOXXOXOOOXOXXX lit tile O unlit tileOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOO OOOO OOOO OOOOOO OOOOO OOO do nothing number press tile in this sequenceIf you make a mistake pressing the button below the panel will reset thepuzzle
When you are done the game will take over and the elevator will godown
Exit the elevator
Climb down the small flight of stairs and get a closeup on the Nara made Age seal
Use the amulet for a triggered memory
This isthe area that blew up destroying the walkway above and releasing that noxiousgreen smoke Turn around and pull the lever to open the chamber
Enter it
Once inside pullthe small lever on the right to close the chamber and open the linking books Left one red leads to Spire and right one blue leads to Haven
Let's dealwith this one first
Touch the linking panel and enjoy the flight
Haven You arrive on Haven inside a chamber that is literally falling apart
This wasa communication cell with a divider wall to prevent Achenar from reaching thelinking book for Tomahna which is behind you inside a stand
Apparently itdidn't work
Closing up on the debris on the floor will show what happened Some high pitched frequency destroyed the divider wall To the right there's a tray that can be tilted to transfer items between thetwo sides
Inside you'll find Yeesha's satchel that triggers a memory of herrunning away from someone
There's also a pipe that can be pushed up to blow ahorn that was probably used to signal Achenar so that he would know he hadvisitors
When you are done go outside Continue forward until the path is blocked
Move the little crab away if itis in the way and move the stone aside
Behind it there's the top half of abroken crystal figurine
It triggers the amulet
Use it to see the brothersfighting each other
Turn around walk forward and turn left
There are twopaths here
One leads to the back of the link in chamber and it's filled withsome sort of structure and the other is a tunnel into the cliff
Take thisone At the top you will see a drawing of a gargantuan creature a Cerpatee as youwill find out in a bit
To the left there's a rope ladder leading down
Tothe right there are two paths one leads up and offers an aerial view of theisland and the other leads to Achenar's camp
Go down the ladder on the left The path leads to the shipwreck you saw when you linked in
To the right nearthe beginning of the quot pier quot there's a totem
Approach it and get a close up Use the amulet
When you are done take a picture of the symbol on the totemand associate this totem with the Cerpatee animal this is part of a puzzlethat needs to be solved later one
Return to the beginning of the quot pier quot andgo forward
On your way to the wreck there's a scene where some crabs eat afish When you get to the wreck you'll be faced with this Age's first puzzle There's a wooden box inside the elevator four cannonballs outside and to theleft and down from the elevator there's another box the counterweight withfour more cannonballs nearby
What you need to do here is figure out how totake some cannonballs up the elevator with you to trigger a pressure plate inthe upper floor that will make a piece of gangway elevate Go to the counterweight box and move cannonballs into it
Return to theelevator
Pull the box outside and move cannonballs inside it
Push thewooden box to the elevator and follow it inside
Turn to the right to see thecommands for the elevator
Wind the counterweight by rotating the wheel andrelease the brake lever to the right
The elevator will go up At the top push the wooden box forward
Wait for the gangway to rise andcross to the other side
Once inside the ship proper you can either go up ordown
Go down first by taking the rope net at the left hand side
This leadsto Achenar's work area
At the end the amulet will react to the stuffedKarnak above the work table There's a diagram on top of the work table
Take a picture of it
It tells youwhich animal eats what and will help you establish a pecking order needed forthe puzzle that also uses the totems
Enter the room off to the side at theback
The amulet reacts to the tools on the table
There's also a tube with arubber reservoir at the end
Pushing it releases a green cloud of the samestuff that made you woozy back in Tomahna
Looking around confirms thatAchenar is one very disturbed person Return upstairs to the middle level
Take the ladder upstairs
Once up there you will be greeted by a Karnak eating a fish
Notice it's hind paws
You cancorrelate this information to the picture you took downstairs
Now beforeentering the ship continue forward until the end
Turn to the right androtate the leftmost gear
This will unfurl the sail and show you a map of theisland along with the territory each animal occupies
It will also trigger amemory The five animals are represented here the Cerpatee at the top below it theMangree and to the right of the Mangree the Camoudile
Below the Camoudile isthe Zeftyr and to the left of the Zeftyr is the Karnak our fish eatingfriend
Take a picture and when you are done push the wooden tab by the rightof the gear to collapse the sail Enter the room to the right and turn right
Examine the treasure chest totrigger a memory
Afterwards go to the other end of the room and examineAchenar's first journal
You can use the amulet for a voice over
Here youwill learn the eating habits of the Zeftyr the Camoudile and the Mangree along with their names
Further along will come the Karnak a scavenger andreferences to the fifth creature When you are done return to the pier
To lower the elevator to the pier justtouch the metal tab next to the winding gear for the counterweight
Then retrace your steps to the top of the cliff
Now take the path to the rightthat leads to the aerial view
You'll see a red flag waving in the distanceand a wood structure to your left
This jungle is a maze and you'll have tonavigate it
Climb down and go to the camp area
Approach the tent to triggera cutscene A Zeftyr will run out and you will use the tent as an hang glider to pursue it I choose to think we're not running away from it in abject terror
Itproves smarter than you as it hangs back just below the base camp and watchesyou crash land
You then wake up with a Mangree looking over you
This sceneis also important as it contains a clue to another puzzle
You will hear aMangree screaming high then low then high again
The one looking over youwill become alerted just in time to escape the Camoudile that bounds over youin hot pursuit of a cold meal When you get up I suggest you do some exploring
It's very hard to givedirections here in the jungle as there aren't many reference points I can use so if you know the places I'm talking about this will be much easier
Lookdown to see some prints
Zoom in and the amulet will react Right now you are in a three way fork with the tent remains to your left
TheCamoudile came from your right
Take the path in front of you
Walk to the endof this path
You will see a Mangree jumping from a tree to another one acrossfrom it and hear the warning call again high low high Go forward again and you'll arrive at what seems to be a dead end
There's thehunting post Achenar mentioned on his journal
You can push the red plantsaside
Do so and this lets you continue to the hunting post
Climb up Turn around and pull the cover down
Another diagram that helps establish thepecking order
Take a picture
The pile of bones to the left triggers amemory
Now observe the three wheels in front of you and the Mangrees at thedistance
Do a close up and you'll see they are playing with the Mangreetotem Unfortunately one of them is always covering the symbol
To make them go awayso you can take a picture of the symbol you'll need to reproduce the sound forthe warning call using the wheels in front of you
This includes not only thepitch but also the duration which is long short long Sorry I can't be of further help but this is something you'll have topractice until you get it right
It also serves as practice for a puzzle withthe same principal later on
I normally manage it by doing of a turn for along duration and of a turn for a short one In this particular case you'll need to turn the rightmost wheel first thenthe leftmost one and then the rightmost one again
You also shouldn't take toolong between changing wheels as this can affect the sound reproducing
Whenyou have managed to reproduce the correct sound the Mangrees will go away Take the picture of the totem and climb down from the post Return to the three way fork and take the path with the tent remains
You'llsee and hear a Camoudile up there stalking prey
Continue forward
At theintersection turn left
Continue forward
You will pass by a Karnak on yourright and going forward from there will lead you to a gate
Zoom in on thepanel to the left
Use the amulet
You'll learn what you need to do to solvethis puzzle Open the panel by pulling on the bottom central area where there seems to bea wood tab
The objective of this puzzle is to get the hammer to rest on thewhite pins without the hammers themselves being inside the sliders
Thesolution is listed below
As there's no way to reset the puzzle save the gamebefore you start solving it to prevent headaches trust me on this one In the solution a letter followed by a number an x and a direction means youhave to move that slider a number of holes in the direction indicated
Thefirst move means move the middle slider two holes to the left t top slidderm middle sliderb bottom sliderlh light hammerdh dark hammerStep by step moves lh downm x leftlh updh upm x rightlh downdh downm x leftlh upt x rightdh upm x rightdh downlh downm x leftlh upt x rightdh upm x rightlh downdh downm x leftlh up gt upper lock doneb x leftdh upm x rightdh downb x leftdh upm x rightdh down gt bottom lock doneAt the end of this the gate opens
Cross it to enter the lake area and theKarnak habitat
Zoom in on the lake to trigger a memory
Turn around zoom inon the totem and trigger another one
Take a picture of the symbol
Now climbdown the trail to the intersection where you saw the Camoudile
Instead ofgoing right and returning to the tent remains trail go forward
You will finda trap on the left side of the trail
Use the amulet to trigger a memory If you continue forward you'll arrive at base camp
Turn around and return tothe intersection
Turn left to the path with the tent remains
Take it
Passthe three way intersection and this time go forward
You can use the Zip modeto get there faster
You'll arrive at another intersection
To the left thereare two Zeftyrs feeding
To the right leads to the swamp area Take the left path to visit the Camoudile habitat
You'll witness an attack inwhich the Camoudile kills a Zeftyr
Pass the feeding Camoudile and the treestump and turn around
There's a Karnak waiting for its turn at the carcassand an axe imbedded on the stump
Use it to trigger another memory Turn around and go to the end of the trail
Turn left and a Camoudile will tryto attack you
Fortunately for you and unfortunately for the poor beast thepoisonous green gas those plants emit will render it unconscious and probablygive it one very bad headache which is nice as it matches the one you'll alsofeel as the vision blurs yet again Wait for your vision to clear and zoom in on the left plant
Trigger anothermemory to learn about the proprieties of the gas and what a sadistic personAchenar is not that it needed any more confirmation
When it ends leavethis place and go forward one screen
Take a right detour here to discover theCamoudile totem Proceed to the end of this little trail and turn right at the huge boulder The totem is behind it
Take a picture and trigger the memory
Now return tothe intersection where you saw the two Zeftyr eating
Climb the path to yourleft when leaving the Camoudile habitat and you'll see two Mangrees runningaway from a Camoudile
You'll also hear the Mangree warning sound again justin case you hadn't figured it out yet Proceed forward to yet another intersection
The path on the right leads tothe Gate area Karnak habitat and the path on the left with the wooden planksleads to the swamp Zeftyr habitat
Take the left path
Enter the swamp andkeep going until you get to a stone with prints on it
There's also a smallfrog like creature Zoom in on the prints to trigger a memory
At the next intersection turn leftto find the final totem the Zeftyr one
As before take a picture and triggera memory
Return to the last intersection and this time take the right fork This leads to the bridge puzzle and this is the one that requires all theinformation you've been gathering so far Climb up and go to the right
Touch the handle on the pulley hanging from theceiling to have the cover over the bridge lock lift
After solving this puzzleyou can return here by pressing the lever to the right when approaching thebridge from the other side not that you need to but it's an available optionif you want to soak up the environment some more
You'll have to enter thecombination again to lower the bridge once you are on this side though The lock has five tubes that look like flutes and each tube has a symbolviewer
Below the lock there's a pyramid just like the one in the huntingpost
To the left there's what looks like a wood fan that will lower thebridge once the correct sequence has been chosen
One of the viewers isbroken so you'll have to use one of the ones either side of it as a referenceto set it to the correct symbol The objective here is to organize the various animals represented by theirsymbols in descending pecking order
From the eating diagram on the wreck andthe diagram on the hunting post the order is Cerpatee Camoudile Mangree Karnak and Zeftyr logic being carnivores first in order on size thenomnivores Mangree and Karnak with the Mangree being more intelligent andfinally herbivores Zeftyr
With this in mind set the tubes like so three holes showing blank square two holes showing three triangles on the vertex of a big one five holes showing first so as to set the fourth tube and then reset toinitial position four leaf clover five holes showing four squares four holes showing letter s rotated degrees Pull the wood fan and the bridge will lower
Cross to the other side and thebridge will come up again
Enter the hut on the left
There's quite a fewthings hidden around and all of them will come in handy very soon Open the trunk nearest to the door to find some pulleys and diving gear Proceed to the next trunk and open it
Look at the inside of the lid
Take apicture of the drawing with the monkey and the squares with dots and markings Approach the bed
Use amulet on the shirt and on the second of Achenar'sJournals From this you'll learn the name of the Cerpatee that Achenar seems to berepenting and on the road to redemption and that Mangrees have names
You'vealready found one inside the trunk
Go to the desk and unroll the piece ofpaper at the top of the small writing plank
Take a picture of White Beard'sname Turn around and climb up the mast
Examine the telescope and have a lookaround
There's another Mangree name on the top of the table
Take a picture Use the amulet on the box next to the drawing
Look at the painting on theeasel
Lift it up can't be in zoom mode to do this and you'll find the finalname behind it
Zoom in take a picture and trigger the memory Return downstairs and exit the hut
Turn left and continue to the jungle
Walkto the end of the wooden walkway until the nasty Camoudile starts snapping atyou
Turn left and proceed to the hut at the end
Climb up
Watch theCamoudile enter this clearing and the Mangrees running for dear life
Noticewheel in front of you
Just like the ones in the Hunting post
Turn around andexamine the diagram hanging from the ceiling
Trigger the memory
Turn aroundand take a picture of the fruit throwing call OK what you have to do here is get the Camoudile to fall into the pit andhave White Beard throw a fruit at him so that he'll disturb one of thosepoison plants and knock himself out
White Beard has to be the one doing thethrowing because is the only one strong accurate enough to do it Unfortunately moving the Mangrees around involves using the wheels tosimulate their names and the game is a stickler for precision
Feel free toturn around and bang your head against the nearest wall
Save the game and prepare yourself for one of the annoying puzzles in thisgame
Each of the names you have been collecting is made up of two tones
Asin the other puzzle there's high and low tones and also a middle one
Thereare two lengths short and long
A square means short and a rectangle meanslong
The names are written from top to bottom so to call a particularMangree begin in the top line and go down
If you need to reset the puzzle atany time walk back to the hut in the middle of the lake and then back here When you are ready here's the sequence Number denotes wheel to use numbered left to right or denotes length of signal This gets the Camoudile in the pit but White Beard isn't in the throwingstation yet I strongly suggest you save your game here unless you want to redo the wholething
You'll have very little time once the Camoudile is in the pit to throwthe fruit Camoudile is put to sleep
Climb down and return to the end of the woodenwalkway
Climb down the ladder and you'll be greeted by a Mangree and see thesleeping Camoudile in the pit
Follow the path to the right and climb thewooden post at the end
This nest is filled with Mangrees
There's a compass and some shirts and linens
Zoom in on the shirts and trigger the memorysequence Turn around to the left and zoom in on the plant leaves with the drawings This is the solution to one of the puzzles in Serenia and also the solutionneeded to finish this Age
It says you'll have to stroke the bottom stripe ofthe third coil of a flying snake you'll see it in just a bit four times tothe left and then pat it on the head when it awakens
I shall name it Quetzy short for Quetzocoatl Follow the path of leaves to the end
If you turn around you'll notice youhave quite a following
The Mangrees seemed to have taken a liking to you
Siton the chair and look right and down
Zoom in on Quetzy and trigger the memoryto see Achenar doing what is needed to wake it up
Repeat what he did when thememory finishes
It will seem like Quetzy is going to attack you but neverfear
Once it's gone touch the lever
The chair will start moving and apassenger will join you for the ride Once the chair stops return to the linking chamber
If you go back to thechair zooming on the lever and triggering a memory replays the ride
Onceinside the chamber link to Tomahna
Tomahna Interlude On linking in to Tomahna you will see Achenar outside of Yeesha's bedroom linking to someplace and the link book falling to a deck below the bedroom Go see what happened
Pull the small lever to open the chamber and when it'sopen use Zip mode to go to Yeesha's bedroom The room is a shambles
Seems like Achenar was searching for something
Go toYeesha's bed and use the amulet on her Journal
You'll find out about Serenia Serenia's viewer code and Yeesha's spirit guide
Of special importance tosolve the bookshelf puzzle is a note on a Friday where there's a drawing ofAtrus working on the bookshelf
She says all the names are written in D'ni andthat she won't forget who is older
This was the final clue to solve thebookshelf puzzle along with the family tree the note from Atrus toCatherine Yeesha's notepad where she practiced her name and the pictures ofthe family
I will not solve the puzzle just know as I prefer to solve Spirefirst Note at this point you could return to the viewer and input Serenia code tosee a picture of it
As with the other codes it doesn't add much to thestory Serenia code Red Yellow Purple Blue Green The image is a place near the link in spot in Serenia
You see a bit of thestone forest maze and water in the distance Go to the bookshelf and zoom in on the lower left display
Trigger a memory tohear Achenar saying quot I knew you had one quot
He has stolen Serenia's linking bookfrom Yeesha
That's where he linked to and that was the book you saw fallingto the deck below
Zoom in on the right compartment to see Yeesha's handprint It says she is a child of water which means her spirit guide is a waterspirit
You'll learn more about spirit guides when you link to Serenia For now exit the room and return to the linking chamber you can use the Zipmode if you want to
Once there pull the small lever to close it and thenlink to Spire using the book on the left
Spire Before you start a warning Spire is evil
Then again so is Sirrus so thatmakes it even
As with any Myst game the details are very important but inthis age they are even more so
Now that this is out of the way look aroundyou
The scenery is beautiful You arrive inside a blown up link chamber
As with Haven the same system wasadopted here
You'll find a book on the bench across the room
Use the amuleton it to trigger a memory
Yeesha's first mistake with Sirrus telling him sheknew D'ni
Second mistake teaching it to Sirrus
Anyway when you are done exit and start climbing down On your way down you'll path a elevator shaft off to the side
Enter it andsee that the call button is broken
You can zoom in on the shaft but you won'tsee much
Exit the elevator and continue climbing down until you arrive at agarden with crystal statues
If you used the viewer code this is what youwould have seen Proceed to the statues and trigger a memory sequence
Turn left and zoom inon the tools bedroll and extinguished fire on the floor
Trigger anothermemory sequence
To the right and back there's a tunnel that leads to anelevator
Instead of taking that route let's go another way
Turn back to thestatues
Proceed to the left and to the back of the statues At the end of this walkway there's a huge crystal jutting out from a stonepipe
Take a picture and note the shape of the pipe pentagon
Zoom in Trigger the memory sequence and confirm that is indeed a pentagon shaped pipe Zoom out
Notice white mark on scale on the fourth position counting the onewhere the indicator is as one
This will become relevant near the end of thisAge
Now turn right Examine the pipe hole
Zoom in and trigger a memory sequence
Jump in andenjoy the slide down hope the Traveler has heat resistant pants
Oncethe ride ends go forward
There's a sort of book device at the end
Pull thelever below it to open
Trigger a memory sequence
This is a circuit board forthe Age
It shows where there's power
Right now nothing is powered up There's a group of four fuses on the upper left side a group of seven fusesbelow that one and a group of fuses on the right hand side
There's also alot of symbols
Each of these represent a location here in Spire kind of likethe power box back in Tomahna To the right of this circuit board is a metal pipe leading up
This is yourexit from this level
Examine the rest of this location
Go left
There's acontrol box here
The symbol on the lid looks like a castle with waves aboveit
It's an electromagnet and the waves represent magnetic forces
Zoom in onthe lid and trigger a memory
Press the button beside it to open the lid Inside you'll find a slider and seven LEDs numbered to There's a power gauge on the right and a switch on the left
Flick the switchdown
Now let's ground some conductors
It took me a few tries to find theright combination but to save you the time here it is move the sliderright left right left and right
This works because one move to the rightlights up LEDs and one move to the left turns two off
All seven LEDs willlight up
The game will take over and you'll see something being pulled downby the magnet force If you now go to the circuit board you'll see that this area is also lit up From there and to the left you can go to the end of the walkway and see anhuge crystal that is storing electricity
A cable leads out into the void andconnects to several floating stones
A ladder seems to lead out to the left but can't be used right now
Turn back to the pipe leading up and climb it At the top move the lever to the left to open the trap door if you had comeby the elevator back at the Statue Garden this trapdoor would be locked andit would be impossible to open it from the outside
This area leads to Sirruswork area botany lab and another elevator to the right and rest area andworkbench to the left For now continue climbing the pipe
This is another control area
The controlbox lid here has a symbol that looks like a ship sailing over some waves
It'sanother electromagnet this one pointing down
Zoom in and trigger a memory What you have to do here is balance out the floating rock you saw coming downwhen you powered the box downstairs
This is all explained in one of SirrusJournal to which we'll get to in a bit and also through the triggeredmemories at the control boxes when they are covered up
You'll learn that thelocation downstairs is a dock and that the floating stone is actually a stoneship Open the box
This one has is exactly like the one below but only with fourLEDs
You need to light up two LEDs here
The sequence for this afterflicking down the switch is move the slider left right and right
Game willtake over and although you won't see it from up here the stone ship will beat the proper position to be boarded at the dock area Climb down to the middle area and go left
Approach Sirrus' workbench
On yourway there zoom in on the floating stone to the left and trigger a memory
Aslong as you are here take a moment to follow the path next to the floatingstone to the end to add a link to the Zip mode
It might come in handy
Do notuse the elevator though
There's no need to and you have some more things todo on this level
Return to the floating stone and continue to the bench
Zoomin on the first of Sirrus' Journals and use the amulet for a voice over You'll learn a lot about how the Age works some of it's secrets and why thestones float
You'll see how the stone ship was created how the electrocrystals work and of Sirrus' failure
Contrary to his brother Sirrus doesn'tseem the least bit remorseful To the right of the journal there's a device that shows how the crystalswork
It also can be used to trigger a memory
Do so
To the right is atelescope that triggers yet another memory sequence
It shows you thedestination of the stone ship
You'll go there in a bit For now go to the left and behind the workbench area
This path leads to theBotany Lab where Sirrus' nurtured a flower to offer to Catherine seen in thepressure chamber in Catherine's Botany Lab and also in triggered memorysequence in Tomahna by Night Botany Lab
Zoom in on the statue and trigger amemory sequence
The Botany work table shows a diagram but that doesn't looklike flower experiences
Looks like Sirrus has been extracting something fromthe plants around here Return to the trapdoor and from there to the dock area below
On arrivinghere notice that a gangway has been extended to the stone ship
Walk to theship and get inside
Push the lever up and it's a small ride to the otherisland
Once there get out of the ship and proceed forward and to the right Cross to the other side and zoom in on the pipe
Trigger a memory sequence andclimb down To the right there's a web of chains
Go there first
Zoom in on the portholeand use the controls on the right to move the view around
There are threeplaces where the blue button will light up but one of them is more importantthan the others
Before you start moving it around trigger the memorysequence
This is where Sirrus discovers that this Age has no bottom and thelink book is lost forever First hotspot is at the bottom of the stalactite that is currently shown inthe viewer
Click on the blue button to zoom in and again to zoom out
Secondhotspot is almost at the top of this stalactite
Again click the blue buttonto zoom in and again to zoom out
To the left of this one is the mostimportant one it shows a crystal jutting out from a windpipe of circularshape and the white mark on the scale is in the third position again withposition one being the first where the middle indicator is
Zoom out from theviewer and go to the machine at the end of the other path This one had me banging my head on the wall for a while
The gears won't turnnot because there's no power as I first assumed but because there's afloating stone nudged in them that prevents them from turning
Touch the stone on the right side of the screen to set it free and then pull the lever
Thiswill enable a floating stone to form a bridge near the stone ship
Returnupstairs Cross the walkway and use the floating stone to cross to the other side Continue to the end to find another circuit board
Zoom in and use the amulet Return to the floating stone and step left to the control box
I forgot tomention we are trying to power an artifact that lets you access the bottommost point of the Age and that looks like a chair with spider legs
I shallrefer to it as spider chair
For that we need exactly conductors to be lit Zoom in on the closed lid and trigger a memory
The symbol here looks like athree stringed lyre
Open the lid
Wow
That's a lot of conductors
After muchexperiment the sequence for the slider here after flicking down the switch is move slider right right left left and right
You need to light up LEDs which this sequence does
Return to the stone ship and to the main spire Now from the island plus the from the dock station makes
All youneed to do is to turn off the ones above the area where the metal pole leadsto upper magnet control room
Go there and turn them off by flicking theswitch up
Climb down and this time go to the right towards Sirrus' restarea and second workbench
On your way there notice a piece of paper on thefloor near a square piece of rock
It's the first note on Quartz crystals Zoom in and take a picture Keep going until you get to the third crystal jutting out from the windpipe This one is broken and there's no scale but the shape is an hexagon
Zoom in take a picture and trigger the memory sequence
This confirms the shape of thepipe and also the position for the last indicator which is set on theseventh Turn around and go to the cot area
Zoom in on the chess set to trigger amemory that completes the one triggered on the chess set back in the Kitchenin Tomahna
Turn around to the water bucket
Notice a piece of paper on thefloor
Zoom in and take a picture first note about the blue crystals
Now goto the workbench On the left there's a rotating display with crystals inside
Below it there'sa note on Nara
Take a picture
On the top and to the right there's a note onrock
Take a picture
Now open the small compartment to find two more notes the one on top about blue crystals and below this one one about rock
You'llhave to move the small gear aside to be able to lift the note about the bluecrystals
Take a picture of both notes Now turn to the right walk forward and examine the hole there
Jump into it At the bottom you'll be face with the spider chair
To the left of the chairthere's a statue with a list of numbers
Take a picture of it as it will helpdetermine the correct frequency for Rock
Open the gate in front of the chairby pulling the lever down
Leave the lever with the lightning bolt symbol asis
Exit through the gate to the other side Climb up the stairs and look to the floor
Zoom in on the note and take apicture
This is the only note about quartz but it's more than enough
Theelevator cab is here but you won't be needing it
Return to the spider chairand sit down
Press the button on the right
A control panel closes over youand everything lights up
If you look carefully to the left side you'll seenumbers next to symbols
These indicate the amount of energy needed to accessa level and this is how I knew that was the correct number
Pull the knobon the left down one position You'll go down and the statue will come down with you
Zoom in on it and usethe amulet
There seems to be a whole lot of flasks around
Pull the knob onthe left down another position
You will go down again and this time you'llsee four displays in front of you
Inside each there's a different piece ofcrystal
On the left there's Quartz and Stone and on the right Nara in theform of a Knight chess piece and Blue Crystal
These are locks and the notesyou have been collecting let you find out what are the frequencies to makethem vibrate and thus open
But before you do that you need to tune themachine Click on the button in the panel that looks like three capital 'E' letters You'll have to open the panel first to reveal the button
Once at the bottom you'll see three gears each with a different geometric symbol a pentagon acircle and an hexagon
Each corresponds to one of the windpipes I told you totake a picture of
On the right there's some tools
Zoom in on them andtrigger a memory sequence
After this set the gears accordingly
Rememberthat the first position counts
Code is Gear one pentagon in th positionGear two circle in rd positionGear three hexagon in th positionIf you make a mistake the white handle in each gear resets it to the originalposition
Once they are properly tuned return upstairs by pressing the bigblack button up and to the left
When the ride ends save the game
Get readyfor another annoying puzzle
Seems to be one per Age
But first let's find outthe sequences Open up the notes on the quartz crystal
The first one says the first slidershould be set to
The second one says the optimum setting is near Push the sliders on the chair control panel to these positions the first oneto the second one to and the third one to
The quartz crystal beginsto vibrate the lights on the conductors turn off meaning that energy is beingspend to make the crystal vibrate
You have the correct frequency for Quartz
Notice that there's only a hole on the Quartz ring and that it spinsslowly Now for the Rock
The notes for rock say that the total power is and thatthe last slider must be set to seen in one of the notes
This means thatthe power distributed to the other sliders has to add up to
There's a lotof combinations but the notes also say that the lab vibrated strongly withone of the melodies from the music chart
So that reduces it to as foundon the last three lines of the chart since this is the only pair from themelodies chart that adds up to
The correct frequency for Rock is Test it and notice the lock behavior
This one has three holes Now for the Blue Crystal
The notes let you know that the setting for thefirst slider is
The other ones must be set to the total output from thegarden which is and docking station which is
The total is
So if thetotal is and the first one is set to three and one of them has to have thefull power from the docking station which is the sequence is either or since both add to
Testing these reveals that the correct one is
Notice the lock behavior by zooming in on it
This one has two holes And for the final one Nara
This is the easiest one
The only note on Narasays that it will have to be all the power the board can generate equallydivided by three
Since the full power is dividing it by three means thefrequency is
Zoom in on the lock and see that it has four holes So frequencies we have now to determine the order
Since the slower vibratingmaterials take longer to get to a hole in the ring it's better to have themset up early
In order of the number of holes this means the correct order along with frequency settings is Quartz Blue Crystal Rock Nara Now for the annoying part
You have to get all four locks vibrating at thesame time and this requires speed while setting up the sliders
This would beeasy if the control system wasn't so clunky and the mouse hovering sensibilitywas a little more sensitive
My suggestion at least for the first setting isto set up the first and third slider to the correct positions and leave thesecond one to the end
As this involves cranking it up to the maximum it buysyou some time
Once it starts vibrating set the next combination and so on With a bit of luck you'll get it right and the bridge in front of the chairwill lower Once this happens click the blue button on the right to have the controlconsole lift up and free you
Walk over to the bridge and cross it
Save thegame
Climb to the new area and you'll see an huge stone slab in the elevatorto the left
You'll have to get rid of it
To your right is a panel with twosettings
Move the slider to the right below the drawing for what looks likea Bishop chess piece Move forward and you'll see a figurine inside an electrical cage
Zoom in andtrigger the associated memory
Oh so the crystal figurines will act as bombsonce they are grounded
Continue to the second of Sirrus' Journals
You'lllearn of Sirrus bitterness his trickery of his mother as well as takingadvantage on her feelings and that he is not the least bit sorry for what hedid he's quite blase about it
You'll also learn of his plans to blow up thelinking chamber how he tricked Atrus into giving him some Nara in the formof chess pieces and his surprise at finding out he has a sister and theanger envy he feels towards her because Atrus chose to teach her the Art ofwriting Ages and didn't do the same with him Approach the nearby dispensers and zoom in on each one
You'll have theopportunity to trigger two memory sequences showing a figurine beingretrieved and deposited into the sliding container
The one on the left ismade of rock and the one on the right is made of Nara
Since you need to blowup the rock slab that is blocking the elevator Nara would be the right way togo
You'll have to make sure that the container is pushed to the left so thatthe Nara figurine will fall to the ground and blow up Slide the container to the left and return to the spider chair
Set thesliders to and watch the cutscene
A figurine slides to the back ofthe other area and an explosion similar to the one witnessed on Tomahna whenthe quake took place will be seen
Seems that both brothers had an hand atthat event
Return to the area that just blew up
The elevator is nowunblocked Enter the elevator
If you want to save the game here as this will be a funride
Lift the lever up and enjoy it
The ride ends on the shaft chamber nearthe beginning of the Age
By the way the ride up here should explain why thiselevator wasn't working beside the slab of stone blocking it downstairs there was a missing section of the shaft that Sirrus substituted forelectromagnets Turn around an zoom in on the medallion next to the lever
Flick the littlelatch and take a picture of the color scheme that appears
This changes fromgame to game so I can't tell which scheme you'll get
It's also part of thesolution to another puzzle in Serenia and the reason why you needed to visitSpire before going to Serenia
Zooming in on the lever replays the elevatorride
Exit the elevator and proceed to the link chamber
Link back to Tomahna
Tomahna Revisited Time to take care of the book shelf puzzle in Yeesha's room
Pull the smalllever right to open the chamber and Zip mode to the bedroom
Once inside approach the bookshelf
There are two rows of books with eight books each Number the books in each row from one to eight
I'll refer to a particularbook like so in which the first number is the row and the second number isthe book On the spine of each book there's a name written in D'ni
After gathering allthe clues Yeesha's Journal where she says all the names are written in D'niand that she won't forget who is older the family tree below the firstconservatory the note from Atrus to Catherine Yeesha's notepad where shepracticed her name and the pictures of the family all that's left to do istranslate the names so you can find out which books to push Since you already have Atrus Catherine and Yeesha's names in D'ni the onlyones missing are Achenar and Sirrus
If you translate the other names you'llsee some familiar names there like Rand for example
Or you could simply tryto find out which are the ones you want from looking at the Family Treepicture
The order to be used as Yeesha says she won't forget who is older is descending chronological
So that would be Atrus Catherine Achenar Sirrus and Yeesha which translates to Push these books into the shelves to have the bookshelf lower
Climb down themanhole to the deck
Step forward and you will see some diving equipment here Continue forward to find a painting on an easel a glowing lamp with beetlesflying around it and Serenia's link book laying on the floor this was whereyou saw it drop to when Achenar linked there
Open the book and link toSerenia Before you start exploring Serenia do a small detour
Turn around do a closeup on the stone pedestal behind you and trigger a memory
Poor Yeesha
Linkthrough the book laying on the floor back to Tomahna
This is a very nicesurprise especially if you played Exile because you are in the same placewhere Exile starts Approach the bench on the left zoom in and trigger a memory that replays thefirst scene from Exile
Turn around and go through the corridor there
At theend turn the little fan knob to unlock the door and step through
The door atthe back of the Botany Lab is now opened
Return to the balcony you just left and turn right to Atrus' office Turn left and go to the leftmost mural
Zoom in to trigger another scene fromExile
Zoom in on the right mural and trigger another memory this one ofCatherine teasing Atrus
Continue to Atrus' desk
The linking book to Sereniais on a bookstand to the right Turn on the lamp on top of Atrus' desk
Zoom in on the feather and trigger amemory
Zoom in on the Journal and use the amulet for a voice over
Thejournal teaches you about Serenia and the family trip there
It also talksabout how Yeesha underwent her Spirit Guide ceremony
When you are done turnright and link to Serenia
Serenia Serenia is a maze like place
As with Haven but even more so here it's verydifficult to give out directions
I strongly suggest you get acquainted withthe Age and at least learn the locations for the water control puzzles thereare three the Spirit Guide manifestation points stone circles for WindGuides circular pools for Water Guides and burning stones for Fire Guides aswell as their shapes Whirlwind Water Column and Flame Column and theirofferings Pollen for Wind Bubble for Water and burning Sap for Fire Start by going forward
Cross the bridge and go past the bubble fountain onthe right
Continue forward past the white butterflies
To your left you'llsee a water wheel and in front of you there's a bridge
Turn left and go tothe water wheel
Pull the control handle on the wheel to the right so as tostop water from flowing to the left
You need to do this as part of a puzzleyou'll encounter later on
There's also a water pool here
Return to the mainpath Cross the wooden bridge
You'll see Achenar walking briskly to the right
Thisis a four way intersection the path from where you came a stone path to theleft a stone path where you saw Achenar in front of you and two woodenbridges to the right
Follow the path where Achenar was
Pass the stone circleto the left and continue to another intersection
You'll see two waterconduits intersecting on the right a path to the right and a path to theleft
Take the left path Turn left and notice a small wooden box in a stone shelf to the left
Zoom inand trigger a memory
This is what Achenar was hiding
Open the box and usethe amulet on the Journal for a voice over
This Journal will let you learnwhat the brothers have been up to in Serenia as well as their intended plansfor Atrus
It also tells you that there's been a fall out between them Continue forward on this path
At the end just before a bridge you'll seesome burning stones
Incidentally if the game takes over when approaching aSpirit Guide manifestation point it means the Guide is there
Do nothing toit tough
I point this out because a Fire Spirit might be here
You'll dealwith them later on
Cross the bridge and you'll be standing under a pollentree
Turn left and go forward There's a water pool on the left and probably the Water Spirit guide isthere
Forward again until you get to another water control point
Climb thesmall wooden ladder on the left
At the top pull the little car right so thatits top wheel connects with the wooden axle
Go forward and pull the handle tothe right
Staying still on top approach the ladder and return the car to theoriginal position
Descend and return to the water pool Turn to the water control and pull the handle hanging from it
This will blockthe water from flowing to the left conduit
As I mentioned above this is partof a puzzle you'll encounter a little while later
Go past the small woodenladder and continue forward
You will come across a stone circle on the rightand probably see a Wind Spirit
Again do nothing to it
Keep going forward You'll be back to the intersection where you saw Achenar
The Wind Spirit maybe in the stone circle next to that path now
This time take the path withthe two wooden bridges
You may be able to see a Fire Spirit to the left at adistance
Go past it
Cross the wooden bridge
Ignore the trail leading downfrom here for now it's a dead end with a raised drawbridge
There's anotherstone circle to your right
Take the left path Another water control and if all went well there should be no water flowinghere
There's a water pool here
Zoom in on the broken wooden cogwheel on theleft and trigger a memory
Once it ends go forward
To the left you'll see aburning sap plant and another one to the right at the distance
Take the pathto the right that leads to another burning sap plant and a pollen tree Pass the pollen tree on the right and the bubble fountain on the left
There'sa path to the left here on which another pollen tree can be seen
Ignore thispath and go forward
There's another bubble fountain here a path to the leftwhere some burning stones can be seen to the right of it and a path leadingforward and downward
Take this one The game will take over and you'll meet Anya
Listen to what she has to say She is one of six Protectors leaving on this part of Serenia
She tells you tovisit the memory chamber so go there
Go forward but make a detour first
Atthe cross roads turn right and go to the end of the path
Zoom in on themosaic and trigger a memory
From it you'll learn that water links everythingin this Age
Take a picture of the mosaic as it is also a map to this Age'sstone maze the one you've been navigating Return to the crossroads and go right
Go down the stairs and at the bottom turn left
Go down these stairs and witness a scene with Sirrus
As usual he's up to no good
When he sees you he'll blow up the bathyscaph to escape Turn right and go forward
Zoom in on the offering plate and trigger anothermemory
Before entering the Memory Chamber in front of you go left and to theback of the bathyscaph
Examine the blown up door and trigger a memory
Thebathyscaph is used to harvest memory globes from the bottom of the MemoryPlant Return to the Memory Chamber and enter it
There are four statues at the back two on each side and they will replay scenes of Yeesha imprisoned Achenarstealing something and Sirrus holding a blue egg
There's a stair leading up but there's no need to go up there right now
The chamber in the middle of theroom holds the pistil of the plant and it's beating like an heart Exit the Memory Chamber and return to where you saw Sirrus inside thebathyscaph
You'll meet a new Protector here she'll tell you about the MemoryChamber and that a few of their sisters have gathered at the Hall of Spirits They'll be able to tell you more about Yeesha when they've woken up
Followher to the back of the bathyscaph
She'll tell you of the existence of anotherbathyscaph and that the pollens inside a Memory Chamber grow deadlier when theplant gets old Once more return to where you saw Sirrus and climb the stairs
At the topturn left and go forward
Cross the suspended wooden bridge and climb down atthe other side
On this plaza there's a statue with and offering plate to theright and a small outcropping to the left
Go there
A tube at the endtriggers a memory when you zoom in
Seems like this is used to call thevillage
Return to the plaza and go left at the top At the base of the stairs there's a stone lid the control is to open it isupstairs
Climb the stone stairs and encounter Achenar
Listen to what hehas to say
It may be hard to believe but he seems sincere
He does seem afew sandwiches short of a picnic basket and he says his brother is mad
Healso mentions the Journal you found inside the wooden box and to prevent Atrusfrom coming here
When the scene ends turn right Walk the wooden walkway to the end
Notice the thing on the water controlwheel
It's a Quetzy just like the one in Haven
This is way you had to gothrough that Age to find out how to release this lock so you can operate thiswater control
Zoom in and trigger a memory of Haven
To release Quetzy stroke the bottommost stripe on the rightmost coil four times to the left andthen tap her on the head
She'll fly away and let you operate the control Don't do it yet though Instead return to where you just met Achenar and pull the red lever thatlooks like the tongue from the statue
Return to the plaza and to theoutcropping
There should be a middle aged woman there
Another Protector She's very suspicious of you but asks you to do a favor for her
She talksabout the importance of water the theft of the Life Stone and the diversionof the water courses
This scene is important because it triggers theawakening of the Protectors inside the Hall of Spirits and lets you moveforward in the game So you'll go there but take the long way so as to discover a bit more of thegame
Return to the stone plaza and to the base of the stone stairs
The lidshould be open allowing you to go down there
Do so
Climb to the very bottom There's a switch here I don't know its purpose and a pillar surrounded bythree more
Zoom in on it to trigger a memory
It's the stone Achenar has beencarrying around Turn left and go forward
Zoom in on the crevice
You'll exit this chamber Incidentally if you had messed with the water control upstairs this areawould be flooded and you'd have been prevented from proceeding this way
Climbup and you'll be on the side from which Achenar made his speech
Proceedforward
This path leads to the drawbridge I mentioned earlier
It's no longera dead end
Now use Zip mode to return to the crossroads after you met Anya orcontinue on this path Once in the crossroads go to the mosaic
Another scene with Anya will reveala little more of what is going on
When it ends go straight ahead to thebuilding on the opposite side of the mosaic
This is the Hall of Spirits
Savebefore you go in
Enter it and you'll be addressed by one of the Protectorsthere
Listen to her explanation and you'll learn you need a Spirit Guide tovisit Dream
She's called Zaneka by the way Note The guide is randomly attributed
Problem is I don't know what triggersit
I've been going through the save I did but it seems I always get the sameguide
It does change when you start a new game
I've been a child of Wind andof Water so far The Imager Viewer will be flashing
Click on it
Notice a hand next to the Zipmode icon
Clicking on it will show a hand print just like the one in Yeesha'sbedroom back in Tomahna
Exit the Hall of Spirits Now that you know who's your Spirit Guide time to go find it
Return to theStone Forest and go to the appropriate spot to get an offering
These spotsare always within a four screen distance from a manifestation place
You haveto take the offering from the tree fountain plant to the manifestation placeby holding it on the cursor
To collect an offering place the cursor belowthe falling material
After you have it in hand you can't do quick or suddenmoves or the offer will disappear but you mustn't take to long or it willalso disappear
Moving more the four times will also make the offer disappear As I have no way of knowing which Guide you have been given here's a tablewith the information you'll need From Collect Spirit Guide Manifests inPollen tree gt Pollen gt Wind gt Stone circleBubble fountain gt Bubble gt Water gt Water poolBurning plant gt Sap gt Fire gt Burning stonesIf the Guide is at the manifestation place you chose touch it with the offerin hand
This will cause and explosion of light and shower of sparkles
Ifnot you'll have to visit every spot where it appears until you find it always bearing the right offer in hand
Once this is done return to theMemory Chamber Before going upstairs save the game here as you are about to experience oneof the most fun puzzles in the game as well as bear witness to a fabulousjourney accompanied by the song Curtains beautiful in itself by PeterGabriel
When you are ready Zaneka will be waiting for you there and willexplain you what to do
Once you get up there the game will take over Enjoy the video
When it ends your Spirit Guide will explain what is going onin Dream and that it will try to help you
It'll allow you to interact alittle bit with Dream and you can play around with the color clouds and havethem follow your cursor around
After some time has passed you'll be taken towhat I consider to be the most fun puzzle I've ever done on a Myst game When the screen has filled up with swirling nimbus if color surrounding awhite one and the Spirit Guide has stopped talking save the game
This puzzleis easy once you know what you are trying to do
The spirit guide told you tobring the Ancestors in closer harmony to the ones surrounding it
White forthose of you out there who don't know this is a combination of all the colorsthat compose light and thus the most harmonious color there is
Your objectivewill be to change all the Ancestors colors to white To do this you brush the cursor through an Ancestor and it changes color
Thecolor sequence is Red gt Purple gt Blue gt Cyan gt Green gt Yellow gt WhiteOnce you get to white the cycle will begin again
The best way of doing this since the clouds are arranged in an hexagonal matrix is to trace triangles ordo zigzag motions
Now there are some rules going from a cloud to another moves the color up one level on the sequenceabove going back on a color that you have just changed causes no effect at first but if you linger to much on it or pass through it without changing colorsaround it it will force a color change on the clouds that surround it white clouds are a bit sturdier to the effect above but will also change ifyou brush past themSo when you are ready begin
Don't be afraid to change a white into a red ifyou need to or do other shapes other than triangles like squares if it isneeded at sometimes
When all clouds have been changed to white the SpiritGuide will tell you you have succeeded and will reveal you two color pyramidswhich will come in handy very soon You will see two white lights separating into three distinct colors each andthen form two pyramids
Make a note of the two pyramids that are shown
Evenif the Spirit Guide says you won't be able to see this revelation again youwill
There's a memory trigger that allows you to review this clue G M YR B CWhere R G B stands for red green and blue and M Y C stands for magenta yellow and cyan
Once you are back on Serenia say goodbye to Dream for now You will be returning there just before game ending
Exit the Memory Chamberand return to the Stone Plaza where you met the middle aged Protector
There'sa Zip mode link leading there
Don't use it until you have exited the MemoryChamber though or you will lose a sequence with Anya As soon as you exit the building Anya will appear and say that she hoped todiscuss what went on in Dream with you but there isn't time
She will remainhere and block anyone from entering the Memory Chamber
Once the door isclosed you can trigger a replay of the last bit of conversation by zooming inon it and using the amulet Once at the Stone Plaza proceed to the water control where you made Quetzy goaway
Turn the wheel to stop the water from flowing to the left canal
Time toface the brothers at their hideout
Return to the crossroads that lead to themosaic and the Hall of Spirits there's also a Zip mode link to it
Oncethere turn left and proceed forward passing under the bell to leave theProtectors section and enter the Stone Forest Climb the wood steps and you'll be at an intersection with a bubble fountainand a wooden bridge
Take the left path and follow it to the end
At the endthere's a burning sap plant to the right and an intersection in the nextscreen going left
Go forward once to the next screen and take the left pathagain
Pass the water control with the broken wheel and at the end of thatpath you'll be where the path leading from the drawbridge connects with thisone
Go to the drawbridge and cross it On the other side there's a stairway leading down next to the winding wheelfor the drawbridge
Climb down this stairway
At the bottom of the stairway proceed toward the door
You'll meet Sirrus as he is exiting the abandonedMemory Chamber
Notice how he backpedals a little
Once he finishes hisspeech proceed to the right and to the back of the Chamber From Achenar's Journal found in the Stone Forest you should have seen adrawing of a back underwater entrance into this memory chamber
There's abathyscaph here and a well
You'll have to drain enough water from the well tobe able to access the secret tunnel and the secret door it leads to
That iswhy you have been diverting the water from this location
If you hadn't doneit water would keep flowing into the well and there would be no way ofaccessing the secret tunnel There are two levers here for controlling the bathyscaph one lowers andraises it the left lever and the other one opens and closes its door theright lever
Begin by pulling it up using the left lever
Close the door onthe bathyscaph by using the right lever and then lower it
Still with the doorclosed lift it up
This will cause some over flow and grant you access to thetunnel
Approach the well and climb down
Once inside climb down once more You should be able to see a glass window and below it a wheel
Turn the wheelto the right to open a drain and allow some more water to drain out
Return tothe bathyscaph controls
Lower it and with the door still closed raise it Again this will drain some more water
Finally open the bathyscaph door lower it close the door while it is underwater and then raise it
This willhave drained enough water to open the secret door at the end of the secrettunnel
Go there now Zoom in on the panel and trigger the memory
This shows you a picture of themedallion in Spire a replay of the revelation your Spirit Guide showed youand then six small triangles separating notice that every dot is white andthe door opening
Click on the button below the panel to open it
You will seea circle of color marbles and sliding channels This is why you had to go through Serenia the medallion there gives you thecolor combination for the six innermost positions of the panel
You then haveto form triangles using the combinations shown in Dream to form six trianglesin the outermost positions of the panel so that when combined each trianglewill glow white
Each small triangle can only be one of these two types G M YR B Cand one of its vertexes has to coincide with the color scheme from Spire As I don't know what combination you got in Spire I won't be able to tell youwhere to place the marbles
You'll have to do it but it shouldn't be toohard
It's just a question of sliding the marbles into place
To move amarble click on it and white lines will show you where you can move it to Select a position by clicking on it and the marble will move there
When youhave finished click the button below the panel to open the door Proceed through the tunnel and climb the metal ladder at the end
Find thehandle on the wheel and turn it to open the hatch
Explore the Memory Chamber You can enter the Shrine itself if you want to but there's nothing to doinside
The plant is protected by a glass cover
To the left of the chamber there's a sarcophagus
If you zoom in on the glass window you'll see Sirrusfrozen inside
Ignore him and climb the stairs to the top of the MemoryChamber At the top you'll see Yeesha strapped to a chair
She'll ask you to releaseher by pulling the silver lever on the machine
As soon as you can save
Thisis where you get to make your choices for alternate endings
I'll explain themin the Final Considerations section
For now go to the machine
When you getthere Achenar will enter
Do as he says and pull the AMBER lever Unfortunately doing the right thing puts Yeesha's body in trouble thenagain she already was with Sirrus inside her body
Again follow Achenar'sinstructions and sit on the chair behind you
Look up to be transported toDream again
Prepare for this Age's annoying puzzle Your Spirit Guide will be waiting for you and will show you Yeesha's mindbeing plagued by a parasite in a form that seems like a beetle with finebinding energy tendrils that are strangling her
This is Sirrus
The SpiritGuide will send you inside Yeesha's memory and you will have to sort them out This place as five images floating around and each of them has one or moresymbols attached
If you float the cursor over one of the symbols it willreplay a piece of a conversation
You have to put the conversation in orderand also place each piece of it over the relevant object
The full dialog isbelow Yeesha Daddy's really good at chess Yeesha You can make one just like you made my spirit guide Sirrus I'd like to sis but I don't have a chess set Yeesha I'll tell them to when I link home Yeesha Well maybe mum and dad could give you a set as a present Sirrus Ha right and I suppose you'll tell them to make it out of thesame rock as this chamber Yeesha You should play him Sirrus I could but it's really hard to carve figurines that small Sirrus That way I'll never be able to break them Sirrus They break so easilyThe available objects are chess set C figurine F painting P book B and Nara crest N
When the correct sequence as well as the right number ofsentences have been placed over an object that object will have a whiteenergy nimbus around it
This is the order the sentences should be put in C F P B N You can only move sentences from object to object in groups
If a group hasmore then one sentence the uppermost one will automatically be placed in thenext object you brush over excluding the one it came from
A sentence isplace in an object in the lowest position and is removed from the highestposition in the group
To acquire a group click on it In order to simplify the solution I'll refer to the object rather than thesentence you will be clicking on to acquire the initial group and then theobject s you are going to distribute that group to
I'll also use theabbreviations above
For example the first step of the full sequence is N gt C means you click on the group over the Nara crest and distribute it to thechess set
Here's the full sequence N gt CB gt N gt B gt PN gt CB gt NN gt CF gt CC gt F gt C gt N gt C gt N gt C gt NF gt PC gt F gt C gt FC gt F done N gt C gt N gt CC gt N gt CN gt C gt NN gt C done P gt B gt N gt B gt PB gt P gt BB gt N done P gt B done gt P done After this one is done you'll have to do another one but this one is aSirrus monologue Father and mother will teach you the art See how round and smooth and empty it is And everything that's you will be sucked out of your body Then I'll put my new memories back on my body and no one will be able tostop me See this globe little sister Of course I'll kill them as soon as I know how to write Ages Lights will go on Leaving behind the perfect disguise for me to step into When I turn the switch the chair you are sitting in will activate Never knowing that it's me who is doing the learningThis time the available objects are memory globe G sarcophagus S chair C and book B
Once more when the correct sequence as well as the rightnumber of sentences have been placed over an object that object will have awhite energy nimbus around it
This is the order the sentences should be putin G C B S Now is also a good time to save if you want to have a savegame right beforethe game ends
As soon as you solve this puzzle the game will end
Fullsequence for this puzzle is following the same conventions I did above C gt G gt C gt BG gt S gt G gt SG gt CS gt G gt C gt G gt S gt B done gt C done G gt S gt GS gt G gt SG gt S gt GS gt G done gt S done Listen to the final reassurances from the Spirit Guide
When you return toSerenia you will see that Achenar's sacrifice due to the revelation he had ofhis brother leads to his redemption
Unfortunately it also leads to hisdeath in his sister's lap
As soon as you stand up from the chair you'll hearAchenar's dying words and witness his death scene
Yeesha will be alright atleast until she grows old and turns into the mad woman we've seen on Uru there's something seriously wrong with this family's gene pool
After this you'll appear in Tomahna and listen to Atrus' conclusions Roll on credits and you'll have the opportunity to listen to quot Curtains quot again After that the game ends
Final Considerations Alternate endingsWhen you are given the choice of levers to free Yeesha from the chair inthe upper floor of the Memory Chamber there are three options you can make Pull the amber lever the standard ending Pull the silver lever Do nothing If you choose number Sirrus inside Yeesha will be freed crush Achenarunder a Spirit Stone trap you in the process and then kill you be shootingAchenar's crossbow Choosing number leads Achenar to stand between you and Sirrus insideYeesha
Sirrus will take the opportunity to backstab Achenar and then shootyou where you stand In both endings Sirrus will also gloat about his performance and of how henow is sure that he'll be able to convince his father that he is indeedYeesha That's it
Walkthrough is over
Hope you've found it helpful and that you'veenjoyed the game

GameBoomers' FAQ for Myst IV Revelation By The Fellowship of the Quest This FAQ document is based on questions and responses from the Myst IV Revelation Quest thread The content has been edited to make it fit more easily into the FAQ format
This document contains hints and serious spoilers ndash there will not be a warning before the spoilers Some of the questions in the Quest thread inspired several responses Multiple responses are therefore included below because differing viewpoints are often more helpful than just one Where there are multiple responses these are designated A Answer A Answer etc
TOMAHNA Getting Power Restored Q Before he left Atrus told me to restore the power in order to be able to use the crystal viewer I am lost and don rsquo t know where to start
A The fuses have blown There is a definitive procedure for restoring power Use the elevator to go down to the middle level See and exchange with Yeesha a couple times
Continue through the various conservatories until you reach a dam that has a lever with glowing icons Pull this lever to reset the generators
Return to Catherine rsquo s workshop where you rsquo ll find Yeesha explaining the power panel When she leaves the room open the power panel roll top
You must transfer power from column to column to get a specific lsquo balance rdquo The spoiler is transfer column to column column to column column to column column to column column to column You rsquo ll see a response that lets you know all is right
Go back to the dam and press the button on the top of the lever Watch the lovely animation of power starting
When you return towards the crystal viewer you rsquo ll experience an lsquo earthquake rsquo this is normal You rsquo ll wake up at night with some walkway damage
Crystal Viewer and Telescope Q I found read journal opened roof switch near the three security monitors got in chair to the telescope hit button that glowed went to crystal viewer and did sequence of shapes and colors and put in correct five spots BUT when I hit red button no Atrus
A To get the telescope working you must open the roof via switch go up in the chair and look at the viewer in close up magnifying glass
Aim the antenna by pushing the button on the top right of the telescope console looks like there's a lighthouse on the button
When you push this you'll see the light become bright orange and you'll hear static starting on the crystal viewer
When you get out of the chair and look at the crystal viewer you'll now see static on the screen there
I have written down a list of the crystal shapes and what number they are on the slider the slider moves so quickly that it's easy to miss them
Here they are Slider Position tear dropSlider Position single spireSlider Position double spire short close togetherSlider Position fox earsSlider Position engagement ringSlider Position multiple spikesSlider Position double spire tall close togetherSlider Position single spire angled topSo using these admittedly strange descriptions link to Rime is solved this way note the console I'm talking about with buttons is UNDER the static view screen Red multiple spikes slot Light blue double spire short close together slot Yellow single spire angled top slot Green single spire angled top slot Dark blue single spire slot Then hit the middle button on the console
A Once you get power up and the roof open and antenna aimed you will be able to enter the crystal symbols into the viewer
The difficulty with this puzzle is that the pictures in the books don't always look exactly like the crystal symbols in the machine
In fact two of the tall crystals the ones with twin spires on them can look very much alike So to alleviate us from this ambiguity some have posted solutions by noting the color and position left to right of the slider the slider is what you use to change the crystal symbol shape
When I am frustrated by a puzzle I like a direct spoiler type of solution like this
So go ahead and enter the symbols and colors per the book
If you still have no image you might try referring to the following solution using the slider position numbers red ndash slider position light blue slider position yellow slider position green slider position dark blue slider position Bookcase Puzzle in Yeesha rsquo s Bedroom Q My eyesight is very poor and I can't make out the titles on the chart and on those books well enough to distinguish quite a few of them so I don't know which ones to push when Could someone please give me a flat out spoiler on those books in Yeesha rsquo s room
A Solution Number the books on top row and on bottom row Click books in this order The bookcase will slide open and the dock is accessible
Fireplace Puzzle Q The fireplace puzzle a hint of some kind will be appreciated A Spoiler Click in row from the top column Click in row column Click in row column and Click in row the first and last column Click in row the sixth column SPIRE The Book that Won rsquo t Open in the Linking Chamber Q When I was leaving Spire there was a book that I could not open which was sitting on the bench located in the front part of the linking chamber
The Tomahna linking book was in a see through case in the back part of the chamber
Was I supposed to have been able to open this book
A The book in Spire wasn't there to be opened I don't think but you should get some information from the amulet when you zoom in
Flying the Ship ndash Setting the Two Power Panels Correctly Q I've gotten the ship up to where I can get on it at the Dock bay went and got on couldn't get it to fly got back off went back to the panel and screwed it up and haven't gotten it back up to flying level again since
LOL Once I get IN the ship I'm not sure how to get it to FLY
Any hints on actually FLYING it
A OK you need a proper balance of PULL from the top magnet and PULL from the bottom magnet
You are where I was you probably have one power light on the top power panel and power lights on the bottom power panel
This is the correct differential i e the bottom must have more lights than the top to get the ship at the docking bay
But you must get the CORRECT balance AND level of power to get the channel open to cross to the floating palace
So if you can find a way to get TWO power lights on the top panel and SEVEN power lights on the lower panel the ship will have the proper differential to float at the dock level PLUS it will have the proper level to fly across So play with the slider on the top power panel first to get it to TWO power lights then fool with the bottom one to get it to SEVEN By the way the power lights are the ones at the top row in each control panel
There are max four possible on the top panel and max seven possible on the bottom panel
Spire Spider Chair Q How do I tune the crystals
I have set and reset the gears several times at the bottom of spire
There is no sound when I move the sliders to open the locks
A Tuning the crystals did you make the connection between the gears beneath the throne place and the gauges on the big crystals up above one near the access to the docking bay one near Sirrus' sleeping chamber and one viewable by the telescope on the other palace
Each set of gears has a different symbol on it and each crystal has a different shaped setting
Each gauge has a quot set mark quot on it and also a lever that is affected by turning the gears below
On crystal the crystal above the access to the dock with the pentagonal setting which corresponds to the first gear the correct setting is four places from the top
All the way up on the gear and all the way down count
Try moving the gear and going back and forth between there and the crystal to see what I mean
You can actually check on two of the crystals to see if they're right but on the one with the gauge blown off you'll have to hypothesize Hope this helps it was the last connection we had to make to get things going anyway
Q O K I'll take the award for most dense
Have read each post re this puzzle at least times
Since I can't get any crystal to vibrate in the slightest am I in the right place to begin with In the spider chair gears have been positioned
Have gone up one level from the gears to a quot console quot that has in the center circles with a crystal in each
There are antennae like thingies with green circles around each between the circles with crystals with two each of the four circles on either side of the antennae array
Is this where I am supposed to be sliding the etc
positions on the green circles of any one of the antennae
I can understand that I am missing accuracy on this and not winning but after numerous tries shouldn't I get some kind of movement out of any of those crystals inside the circles Edit you can go in the sequence of hitting the antennae
I believe I am in the right spot doing the right thing its just reading somewhere that when you got close to the right positioning the crystals shake
Mine surely ain't shaking
A This happened to me
It was because my gears were incorrectly set
The gears start out in the number position
I thought they started at zero but they don't
Reset your gears and start counting again from This puzzle is a BEAR
Good luck
A You are probably off by one on each gear
Spoiler The gears should be on position and Remember that you START on position so click three more to get to position And yes it is BEST if you go then etc on the sliders
You will move faster if you do it that way and the game allows it
Q Yes well I'm stuck also I got that blasted chair moving and am now hanging below it with no clue what to do
There are three gears in front of me and I can pull each one down once and they lock in place and the only way to release them is to press the levers under them is that what they are supposed to do
I think I'm missing something somewhere ndash A Those gears should be moveable to any of the notches
You need the correct tension to solve the next puzzle
There are clues to it in the documents Sirrus left around
Stop reading now and go back and read up or Complete Solution Move left gear to the th notch important note you START on notch for each gear not notch center gear to notch and right gear to notch
Then go up for the toughest perhaps of all of the Myst IV puzzles tuning the crystals
Q I got to the spider chair to adjust the crystals I touched the slider on the left and sparks flew out of the machine next to the door and all the lights went out on the spider chair control and the panel went dead
Was I supposed to fix that machine somehow before I tried to adjust the crystals
A A simple hint for the spider chair is that you've just blown the fuse you havetoo muchpower connected to the chair
Q Okay set the gears at there position noting that one is already in position now going back up to the keyboard slider I have a question here hellip once you play the first frequency do I press the left blue button and play the second set of tunes and so on
A OK you are at the Spire spider chair about to play the frequencies to vibrate the crystal rocks
This is tricky because it's timed
Some of the crystals vibrate for longer times so they should be tuned first
You have to get all four vibrating tuned at once to move on NO NEED TO PRESS THE BLUE BUTTON BETWEEN TUNINGS So once one rock is tuned IMMEDIATELY move the same slider that your hand is grabbing to the next position that is there is no button to push between each tuning
Just get it vibrating then move on quickly
You don't have to move the sliders starting from left to right hellip any order will work Hope this makes sense good luck
Q The keyboard music tunes is way too hard I don't know if I am doing it right When I get the first set and the slider is up can I go slide back down to set the other set of tunes What I am trying to say when I slide the first set to set the second set could I slide down the slider all the way and set the second or can I slide up and down
I hope someone understands what I am trying to saw hellip because sometimes when you adjust the sets you don't have enough room to set the other set to go up
A Yes this was the most difficult one for me because of the timed nature
You have the order correct
Think of it this way for the first set of three slider settings the crystal will be quot tuned quot the moment you get that third slider on quot quot No need to release the slider at this point what worked fastest for me was to then immediately drag the slider from quot quot to quot quot which is what the right side slider needs for the second crystal tuning then I jumped to the center slider and moved it from quot quot to quot quot side note this is a tricky one because you want to drag it all the way to the bottom but be careful it is possible to pull the slider down BELOW the quot quot
The same is not true for the quot quot s you can shove the slider all the way to the top and it will lock on the quot quot s
Then the left slider etc See what I mean
The moment the crystal is tuned and vibrating just move right on the next settings you have to be fast because you need all four crystals vibrating at the same time to solve the puzzle
A Re Spire spider chair harmonics
I finally worked it out
I couldn't really find help elsewhere that would help me shorten the time to move the sliders but here is what I did I noted that it didn't matter which slider you started on or you finished with to create the element vibration i e etc I found it a lot easier to focus on the 'lights' rather than the notches on the slider for counting
Once the white quartz harmonics started the border between on off lights in the bank had turned the corner
From this point I found it easy to count lights on or turn off through the 'feel' of the appropriate slider So I made my slider sequence starting with quartz then The corresponding lighting sequence is off off then with a deep breath slide off the race begins then to slide on slide on then take off slide off pause slide on slide off slide off pause then push all three sliders to the top
I use the word 'pause' so that you come to a complete stop and not to a 'rolling' stop as some auto drivers often do Anyway focusing on counting lights on off once I passed quartz was my saving grace
I know one thing I'll never be a Starfighter pilot
A Here is a step by step for solving the slider tuning puzzle
When you sit in the chair all the crystals lights around the edge are dark Left slider is Center is Right is QUARTZ Push until crystals are lit starting with lower right side and going counter clockwise Push until more are lit Push all the way upBLUE CRYSTAL Pull all the away back reset Push up until crystal lights up Pull back until crystals go out Push until until crystals light up ROCK Push until more crystals light up Push until more crystals light up Pull until crystals go out NARA Push all sliders all the way up to Sure saves trying to count little dots
A I thought I'd write this for encouragement to those of you who are having trouble but want to finish the puzzle yourselves Speed isnotthe important thing here accuracy is
If you set the sliders only approximately right the crystals will vibrate but the vibration won't last long enough for you to finish the puzzle
But if you take the time to set each exactly right the crystals will vibrate much longer and you will be able to move a bit more slowly
So practice practice practice
until you can set each slider by sight exactly where it is supposed to be without counting
Just remember lots of us even little me
have finished this puzzle and we are here to hold your hand
A One thing that really helped me on the crystal tuning in Spire was to turn the cursor color setting down to its lowest level like it helped me to turn the cursor to red in Haven
You can then set the cursor directly over the top of the slider and actually see the green marker through the slider and know when to stop
A Spider Chair Strategy
Before setting the sliders on the spider chair you must be certain that the gears under the chair are set correctly If you push all three sliders to the very top of the console and the knight in the top right lock does NOT tremble and retract then you know that the gears aren rsquo t set correctly
Setting the sliders is tricky
The slider opening window tends to ldquo slip rdquo downwards
Put the center of the slider window slightly ABOVE the green circle marker you rsquo re aiming for ndash it rsquo s more likely to stick there
When you pull the slider to the bottom there is a slot ZERO possible below slot
Make sure you don't go too low when trying to set slot
Each slider sequence i e is one sequence can be set in any order ndash you don rsquo t have to go left center right each time
Once the first two sliders are in position for a sequence you don rsquo t have to accurately set the third slider at all ndash you just have to move the third slider up or down PAST the third setting hitting it for only an instant as you continue to the next setting without letting go
The final setting is easy ndash just bring all the sliders up to the top as fast as you can
Even here though they can slip down ndash make sure they rsquo re completely at the top
The order of the settings Here is the step by step fastest order for tuning the Spider Chair CrystalsRIGHT SLIDER to LEFT SLIDER to
Timed portion doesn rsquo t begin until you set the center slider
CENTER SLIDER to up at the very top don rsquo t let go CENTER SLIDER to LEFT SLIDER to RIGHT SLIDER past don rsquo t let go then down to CENTER SLIDER to center slider knob on a horizontal line with the right slider knob LEFT SLIDER TO go past without stopping CENTER SLIDER TO RIGHT SLIDER TO HAVEN Elevator Balls in Box Puzzle ndash Getting into the Shipwreck Q Have explored around the shipwreck further
Discovered that the cannon balls can be moved
Tried moving all of them into crate and tried to crank it up but too heavy
So removed one and then it went up
Also found a movable box inside where the crank wheel is
Moved it over and put all the cannon balls into it
Then I cranked the box up
It won't stay up though when I move out
What must I do now
Thanks again for all the help here
A The box must have the right number of cannonballs in it to allow the lift to go up remember to crank the rope each time you try
Then when at the top you push the box off of the lift and it raises an access bridge to the shipwreck
Enter the shipwreck and explore
Lot's to see and learn
Q Here's what I did put balls in box to left of elevator balls in box in elevator
Turn wheel to raise box outside elevator turn and push box on elevator off then pull lever
The elevator goes up
But when I go towards the ship can only go one step forward
There is a section of the boardwalk missing here
What could be the problem here
Sure hope you can tell me what I should be doing
A Raise the elevator before pushing the box off
Gate Puzzle in Woods Q Is there a way to reset the gate puzzle
I have tried closing it but it doesn't seem to work
A You are talking about the gate puzzle in Haven right
With the wooden gate and puzzle on the left of it I could not find a way to reset this
I read in another forum that there was no way to reset it
If this is so then you'll have to figure out the puzzle like I did by thinking it out
So start by understanding how the lock works You must get the sliders top and bottom ones completely off of the little silver buttons
Then once this is done and the sliders are no longer blocking the silver buttons you flip the latches onto the buttons gate opens You can maneuver left and right by flipping the latch up and down
Experiment and you'll get there
Q I am at the gates in Haven I cant get the top or bottom sliders to move the hammers are open but they sliders will not move
The middle slider moves freely
How do I get the top and bottom slider to loosen up
A OK here's how the lock works
There are three sliders that you can grab and move left or right
Also there are two vertical quot rockers quot that can be toggled up or down
You have to understand how they work and the only way to do it is to try playing with them
Try grabbing and lifting the metal rockers up and down and after doing that then try to slide the three sliders left or right
Try all three
I guarantee that at least one of them can move
It's a game of toggling the rockers up and down then sliding the sliders that are quot free quot right and left
You work the puzzle until the little metal buttons no longer have the sliders covering the two little buttons
When you have achieved this you can then toggle the rockers onto the two buttons to open the gate You have to get to the point where you understand the movement and it sounds like you haven't gotten there yet SLIDERS move left and right when the rockers are engaged in the right spot
ROCKERS can be grabbed and toggled up and down to release the sliders These are my terms for these elements they are the best I can come up with
Monkey Totem Puzzle Q Oh Oh I've missed a clue somewhere and I don rsquo t know where
I'm in a jungle hut blind looking at monkey critters playing on a totem pole
In front of me are three siren horns
I suspect that I must play the horns in some sequence to rid the 'critters from the totem
If this is the case where would I find this clue So far I've been able to open the wooden gate puzzle and have seen four other totems and the symbols in my travel
I believe I need to know the symbols to open the draw bridge
A If you've read Achenar's journals you should have read some interesting things about how the monkeys communicate you could try pretending you're a monkey but you'll need to listen to their language a bit first On a similar note I seem to have quot finished quot all of Haven having only found four totems total I still don't know where the fifth one is
I found one by the monkeys one in the grassland one in the swamp and one behind the wooden gate but the fifth one seems to have gone on a vacation A I can't remember where I found the clue
I thought it was there in the hut on a piece of paper
Try the in game hints
You have to play three tones I think some short some longer then they'll scatter Yes you need the totem symbols and their order must be correct for the drawbridge
There are solutions for it in this Quest topic
The totem that most seem to be missing is the one on the beach near the shipwreck
A Thanks again
I finally got rid of the monkeys from the totem Its wheel for seconds I think about a turn wheel for seconds about an th and finally wheel again for seconds
Drawbridge Puzzle Q Does anyone here know the right order to lower the bridge
A I think the order is determined by the document in the quot hunting lookout quot
This is the elevated hut that has the view of the totem that is covered by the little monkey creatures
There is a document that shows footprints of the various creatures I used the in game hints for this which says the order of the symbols for the bridge puzzle is determined by the quot food chain quot order of the different animals
In other words start with the most dangerous animal left symbol and put them in descending order to the least dangerous animal
Q Can you help me with the bridge I don't know to what animals the symbols belong to I am only sure of the mangree symbol
A The Cerpatee is the white square The Camoudile is the triangles at The Mangee is four triangles The Karnak is two triangles at The Zephyr is two squiggley white globs with a diagonal quot S quot like line between them How do you like that description for the Zephyr
Mangree Camoudile Puzzle Q Now I am at the mangree puzzle
trying to figure out how many times to turn these wheel Found the sketches of the mangree don't understand what are they for hellip Anyone been here a little push would be nice hellip How much is seconds
Looking at the hint in the game
A There are four Mangrees each with their own quot call quot which consists of two tones
There are pictures of each one with it's call code indicated
The top row is the first tone and the second row is the second tone
A short dash in column one would mean you turn the left wheel for seconds
A long dash in column two would mean you turn the center wheel for seconds Another timed one you have to be really quick with the final three tone signal which causes the Mangree on the far left to toss the poison berries before the Camoudile gets free from the pit
Took me about four tries
Q Finally I get to understand this puzzle but what I don't understand is when I got the camoudile in the pit and I press the final tones the mangree doesn't come out Is the elderly white one supposed to be in the leftmost nest or can any mangree be there I been trying this for about hr now and when the camoudile is in the pit and turn the wheels to tones no one comes out to throw the berries at him hellip For example if I have the white one in the leftmost nest ready to throw him the berries and turn the wheels to the tones he doesn't come out and I do it again and he comes out but by that time the comoudile gets out hellip and I have to start again with the set up I hate this one I rsquo ve got a map of the nests and who is in each of them and get a set up so he can chase the mangree to the point when he falls in the pit and have one of the mangree in the leftmost nest to be ready to throw him the berries but they just don't come out Maybe I have the last tones wrong These are the tones I am using wheel long tone w short tone w short tone A Those are the correct tones
I made the mistake several times of going from wheel then wheel and instead of to to but you have it right Here's what I finally did I chased him around till the white mangree was in the left nest then used only the other three tones to chase him until he is pitted
That way the white mangree was ready to toss the berries Hope you get it
The only reason I saw for the mangree not to react was that I made a long tone too short or slipped with my hand
The short tones seem to work with just a little beep even less than a half second
Q Could I get the spoiler for the mangree puzzle
The hint system in the game isn't working correctly
There are words missing at the bottom of the pages
And on this solve and are missing
Anyone else have this problem with the game
A I didn't have a problem with the in game hints but many other have reported that half a page is missing reportedly due to video drivers that are not the latest
Problem is many are reluctant to go back and look because it takes so much time If you miss getting him the first time according to the ingame hints then you'll have to try again and the pattern of the in game hints won't work
So you'll do well to read what we said and hopefully learn enough to solve it by understanding the basic logic
Keys Make sure you get the white mangree in the left with poison berries hutch then leave him there Then chase the camoudile around with the other three mangrees only till he falls in and use the tones QUICKLY
to have the poison berry thrown
Q Just wanted to vent my frustration
I am STILL stuck on the Mangree Camoudile puzzle
I have been on this one part of the game for days now and I still can't get the Mangree to throw the berries
UGH
A I am sorry to hear that you are still stuck on that puzzle I have to presume that you read all of my posts on this one right
Have you gotten the white mangree into the left most hutch the one with the berries
Have you then chased him with the other three mangrees avoid using the code for the white mangree and he'll stay there
Eventually with only the three mangrees chasing him around he will fall in again
Have you gotten him into the pit
Have you been able to give the code for the berry throw in time I'm guessing that you are achieving the first three but are late on the last one eh
I found that I could just give the wheels a brief yank less than seconds for sure for the quot short quot tones and that helped me speed up the toss of the berry
A Unfortunately you cannot quot test quot a throw from the white mangree if the camoudile isn't in the pit hellip he just swears and gets frustrated It's wheel for sec wheel for sec wheel for sec
I made the mistake of going from wheel to to
That is wrong
A What I did was pull a save after I was sure I had all the mangrees in position except for the last one before the attack call Then before I went back in I practiced on paper what I had to do
Also to memory I found on attack call that last short seem to be quot just a SHORT quot Q That dratted Mangree Puzzle I have codes for the four mangrees short short long long short long long short short Now what
When I put in the codes just to see what is where the little Mangree's hutch's open but they don't go anywhere
I have tried different order of playing the tones but no one runs across the ropes with the exception of one in first hutch on left runs to the hutch on far right
I have read all threads on this puzzle but don't see anything that explains the sequence Any help out there from people who have gotten through this one
A You are missing the code for the white mangree its LEFT long CENTER long The last code signal is the command to throw a poison berry The posts here don't explain a sequence but they do tell you what you have to do The mangrees don't like to run too often
They sit and stare when they are tired
This usually happens when you go back to one too soon
This was discussed in some of the posts here
So read the posts
Q Ok if the first thing I do when the puzzle is reset leave and walk all the way up the path and back down resets the puzzle is hit and the mangree on the left opens his hut
I haven't got him to leave the hut after that
What am I doing wrong
I am totally ignoring the Myst hints and trying a new combo every time
I tried to solve it again tonight and gave up after hours of trying
I get the camoudile in the pit quite often
I do the l s s with VERY short tones and NOTHING ever happens
I'm at my wits end
above get the white mangree in the left hutch then work with the other three keeping track of which one you quot called quot so you don't go back to him too soon that is rotate through the three
A
Have you gotten the white mangree into the left most hutch the one with the berries
Have you then chased him with the other three mangrees avoid using the code for the white mangree and he'll stay there
Eventually with only the three mangrees chasing him around he will fall in again
Have you gotten him into the pit
Have you been able to give the code for the berry throw in time It takes experimentation to get there
If you reset the puzzle you have a longer road to hoe
When I started at the beginning it took about moves to finally get the white mangree in the left hutch
Keep moving them until the white mangree is in the left hutch he is left and center
Once he's there leave him there and work with the other three to get the beast into the pit
Then hit the tone code and zap him
I just tried it again and it does work Sorry you are having so much trouble
Hope this helps
Q
Isn't that the white mangree in the hutch to begin with
Or am I suppose to put the really white one in there
If so then no I haven't got him there
Don't know how
I've chased the white mangree but none of the mangrees ever go in the left hutch
And the mangree that starts in there never leaves
I have gotten the camoudile in the pit MANY times
I give the code and never have berries thrown
A
Nope the white Mangree doesn't start there
You have to move the mangrees around it'll take several moves
Experiment and remember to rotate which mangrees you move
I just did it with my game and the white mangree does go to the left hutch after several moves
The mangree that starts there will leave
Good
That's half the challenge
With the camoudile in the pit and the white mangree in the left hutch and the correct code given berries will fly
You have to have to be quick
Q I went back and tried the Mangree puzzle again determined that it was not going to defeat me but I think I have a kink in the Mangree puzzle I get the Mangrees in the right places
I try to open the white Mangrees nest when the bad guy is in the pit the white Mangrees nest does not open on the first try
I have been really careful the last few times I have redone the puzzle and turned both wheels twice
The nest opens on the nd try and it is too late
This has happened over and over again
A That happened to me as well
Once I had him in the pit and turned the wheel the monkey would not come out and do it again but it was to late and also this would happen as well when he gets in the pit and I turned the wheels the white monkey would come out and throw him with the berries and nothing he would come out of the pit again and I had to start all over again this happened to me about three times just when I got him on the pit and the monkey throws the pit nothing would happened hellip This how I succeed once I know that one of the monkeys is going to be place on the rightmost nest and I know that thing is going to chase him my hand on the wheels for the white monkey ready to throw him the berries I know this part gets nerve racking relax and just remember the combination even before you touch the wheels don't give up it will take some time and a lot of practice I thought I would never get this one but I calm down and set him up and ready to throw him with the berries
A I DID IT I DID IT I DID IT
I put the bad guy to sleep in the Mangree puzzle
I realized what I was doing wrong I was trying to open the nest first
Then all of a sudden I thought you dummy try the attack mode and it worked nd time
Q How do I get the mangree out of the left hutch
Any code sequence I can try
I think I have tried everything
I've NEVER had ANY puzzle tick me off like this one
A This is supposed to be fun so don't let it get to you If you have reset the puzzle and are starting from the beginning try the following L R R C L R L C this is the white mangree C L L R R C L C this should move the white mangree into the left hutch After he gets there don't play his tone again
Use only the remaining three until the beast gets caught then hit him with the poison tones QUICK
Q I am at the infamous 'Mangree Camoudile'puzzle I have a couple of questions
How precisely must the wheels be set this'hamhock'of a cursor gives little leeway Must I rush to turn the wheels before the'ATTACK' sequence hellip or can I take my time
I'm not getting any Mangree action why doyou suppose
A
Not very precisely
I found that experimenting was the best way to know
I rotated the wheel steadily for about seconds for the quot long quot and just a short chirp for the short
I think it basically just needs to be able to distinguish between short and long
Biggest cause of failure is due to a hand slip where you go up and down instead of around with the wheel
Take your time on the wheels when moving the mangrees around no rush there
BUT
when the camoudile falls in the pit there is a BIG rush to play the poison throw tone to get him before he climbs out of the pit
The mangrees won't move if they are tired i e you went to a mangree again without resting him at least two moves by the other mangrees
They also seem to not move if there is not a convenient perch open for them i e they only move to certain perches from certain perches
SERENIA Getting to Serenia Q In Haven I touched the lever amp I went flying across the island to the cove with the linking chamber
Inside was the linking book to Serenia right
A The linking book you used in Haven brought you back to Tomahna not Serenia
Tomahna is where you started the game as you know To get to Serenia you have to go to the dock under Yeesha's room
That is where you'll find the Serenia book
After you first link into Serenia you'll see a link book on the ground that will take you right back to Atrus' study in Tomahna
Then you can permanently unlock that door in Catherine's study so you can go back and forth
After you have explored Atrus' study there is a link book there to take you back again to Serenia and work on that Age
Dreamworld Floating Lights Puzzle Q Well I have dreamed about as much as I can take Is there a strategy for the dream puzzle
A Serenia is a very cool age
I found that various protectors would speak to me in different places as I left and came back numerous times
For me the protectors in the chamber didn't awaken until after I closed the last water gate down by the workshop If you click on the colored floating dots you will notice a pattern to the color changes
All colors change in the same order
I can't remember what the order is but for fun let's say its Red Purple Blue Cyan Green Yellow White I KNOW that the last two colors are Green and Yellow
So any time you see a yellow dot ONE click will turn it white every time
Green dot TWO clicks turn it white
You have to get all of the colors White quot to achieve unity quot
The only problem is you cannot go back and forth between only two colors must use three in a triangle as a minimum or it will not change the colors
It is hard because you cannot see beyond a limited field of view so you can't see where any remaining colored dots are
But rest assured when you get the LAST dot to turn white the dream speaker will immediately tell you that you've succeeded
If he doesn't speak to you it means that there is AT LEAST one colored dot remaining that needs to change to white
This means that you'll have to make your way left and right and up and down turning dots that are already white back to colored so you can travel around
Know what I mean
Q I am in the Dream world
Staring at multiple lights of different colors The spirit guide ldquo in order to get message from Yeesha I have to seek the ancestors rdquo I don't understand how to make the colors do what and what order etc I sense it has to do with the colors I found in Yeesha rsquo s journal but don't know how to do this puzzle I'm touching lights all over the place and getting nowhere
A I've also done this puzzle
The strategy to take is to methodically work your way across the field of colours using triangles of three lights at a time
Keep going round the triangle until the lights go white and then rotate the triangle to include fresh colours
Your may well have to allow lights to go red again to work your way around the whole area Eventually you'll get down to the last few lights and not be able to wipe them out very easily
In this case keep wandering around in triangles trying not to repeat yourself until you find a white light that will not change this is Yeesha
Then you can work at the lights around her until they all go white puzzle solved
A Remember the fact that the colors change in a preset order
So knowing this you'll be able to tell when you are a click or two away from turning white
This way you can plan your clicks so that you get groups of them to turn white and lead you to the next colored one
You don't actually click you just pass over them with the cursor Also a very big key If the voice doesn't tell you that you have succeeded then it means that there is at least one more colored spot out there
It may mean you have to turn spots that are already white back to colored so you can quot traverse quot around looking for the last colored ones
Q I can't seem to grasp the method needed to do this Sometimes the screen is almost white with all the right ones but then colors keep destroying all I do Is it possible to give an example of how to do a color triangle using some colors to explain And how do I move on without the others getting wrecked
A The next triangle will almost certainly have light s in common with the previous one Just keep going round the triangle until a light goes white and then modify your triangle repeat until all triangles go white Patience patience
A You have to turn them ALL white
No really Fortunately this is one of those puzzles where you're bound to get it eventually if you just keep going
A few tricks I found helpful When you get down to only a few patches left start working in triangles of three And colors change in a certain sequence
As I remember they started at dark blue and each time you touched them they would change to the next color eventually reaching yellow and then white
So go for the dark blue ones first then the next color etc working your way up to the yellow and white ones Try to get as many pieces as possible to be all one color regardless of WHICH color
Then change them all at once until they're all white
Q I give up on the Dream Realm there must be thousands of those things to change color I get a bunch of them white then get the bong bong bong and they all change again I tried one color at a time and everyway I could think of and nothing works
I have tried for hours
Why don't they stay white when you make them white
I know just to drive us crazy
Thanks for all of everyone rsquo s help in this game it has been fun
A They go back to coloured if you move from A gt B gt A instead of A gt B gt C gt A
A Yes you must make sure that you don't go back and forth between two the dream world doesn't like that and will make a 'bong' noise and change the ones in the immediate vicinity back to colored
A It took me two days to complete the dream world puzzle but what I found to be easier was the triangle of three like touching only three at a time in a triangle For example then go back to until turn yellow then white keep doing this triangle of three all over with the color lights if you have to sacrifice a white one to make another triangle do so hellip
This puzzle takes a lot of time and patience eventually you will get it don't get discouraged when sometimes they turn back to colors just keep doing the triangle and eventually you will get the last one to turn yellow and then white hellip Spirit Guide Puzzle Q Spirit guide gave the offering but nothing happened Very difficult to carry the offering to the spirit guide when the spirit guide is no where to be found Anyone manage to get pass this one if so how did you do it I think the offerings are too far away from the spirit guide by the time I get the offering to the spirit guide I loose it hellip
A When you give the offering to the spirit it will hang around for about seconds and I think I remember some kind of reaction some sparkling
If it disappeared immediately you were probably too late
It took me tries
I was always late or dropped the gift In any case I had expected something bigger like the guide talking to me or escorting me
That doesn't happen So you may have been successful
A I found there were three important things about this puzzle
If you go more than about screens the bubble dandelion fire thingy will pop fly away disappear so if you have to go further than that you're going to the wrong place
There are numerous wells etc and there are also multiple bubble etc
generators
Each generator is within an appropriate distance screens of ONE well tornado fire but not necessarily the one you're trying to get to
Once you get to the proper screen you need to click on the spirit guide
Otherwise your bubble etc
will pop etc
The spirit guide is only at ONE location at a time
If you walk by it and don't have an offering it will usually change locations
So even if you manage to reach the well etc
before you lose your offering the guide may not be there
It might be a good idea to check where it is before you start
You can usually tell from a distance if it's there or not
A Bubble to spirit For me I found the best place was the bubbles just outside the cave where you come in from a linking book
I would take a bubble from there and gently walk clicks down the path and slowly turn left and up those stairs one click and carefully turn to my right and then its like a very small moment where we look at each other but don't hesitate and then I clicked left mouse and it worked
I hope this will help someone
Q The spirit guide came up as long as I don't get close to it it will stay there so I came back with the offering got close the view turn towards the spirit guide and I had the offering in my hand and it stood there and then it disappeared I don't know if I succeed or not how can I tell if I need
A Did you click the offering over the guide Did sparks swirl around
I got the air spirit guide so I don't know what the fire amp water ones do in response If you go to the dream chamber without having succeeded I'm sure you'll not be able to dream so youcantell
Q Do we have to feed all the spirits in Serenia or just the water spirit
How do you know which place they are going to pop up or is it just by guess and by golly
A if you got the water spirit that is the only one you to feed offering hellip Where you see a pool and if the water spirit comes up do not approach it turn away from it and go get your offering and then come back to the same place you last saw the water spirit If you approach it without an offering it will splash back down in the pool and then you have to check the other pools to see in which one it is in So when you go search the pools and you see it don't get close to it go get your offering and come back and then get close to it with your offering and quickly click on it
A We presume that the protector that spoke to you DID say that your spirit guide was the water spirit right
That is how you determine which one to go to she will tell you
Harvester Water Wheels Puzzle Q Can't get access to the back of harvester I even read the hints but still can't get enough water out of the well to get access to the back I think I have these waterwheels all wrong but don't where to start The waterwheel that was locked with that snake thing in which direction should the water flow left or right The waterwheel with the broken wheel in which direction should the water flow left or right I moved it so now I don't remember which way it was before The waterwheel with the handle and rope in which direction should the water flow I moved this one and I don't remember in which direction it was before I follow the direction in the hint system and I have no access to the back and maybe I am looking the wrong place to access this secret tunnel Anyone could help me out in what I am doing wrong would be most appreciated A The water in the two upstream diverters should BLOCK water going to the left i e let the water flow right only The one with the snake puzzle near the workshop just needs to be turned so the water fills the fountain next to it
No diverting necessary But you are not done yet
You have to do a few dunks and drains using the harvester and playing with the harvester door to it to drain the last bits of water and get access to the door
You'll know when you've done it because the door down the stairs inside the harvester area will be open when you get there
Q Done the diverting with the water everything is flowing to the right except the one with the broken cogwheel it has three paths of water The waterwheel on the stone plaze the water flow is to the right The one with handle and rope is also flowing water to the right cart I been dunking the harvester about times and nothing I even added water inside the harvester and closed and brought it up and open the harvester and spill out water and nothing is happening
A Maybe you are misunderstanding WHERE you go to get into the secret workshop door The quot back quot of the harvester does not open
It is not where the secret door is The place you want to go is found by looking down in the pit where the harvester goes
Look on the right side of the pit You should get a quot forward quot icon
Go down there and you'll see some stairs and once you've emptied the water enough you'll the access to the infamous door puzzle
A Finally got access to the stairs I knew I was looking in the right place for the stairs I could see them even with water in the pool What I didn't notice was that the waterwheel with the broken cogwheel there shouldn't be any water flowing there
I couldn't get the other waterwheel to stop the flow by the broken cogwheel even if I turned them all right
So turned back all the waterwheels back to its original position and started again and then when I went back to the broken cogwheel there was no water flow there this is when I knew I got it right this time So when to the harvester empty out some water had access to the stairs turned the wheel under a window which opened a tunnel went down but the door was locked so went back to harvester empty some more water and went back down the stairs and the door was open
Snake Challenge Q Try as I may can't get the lousy snake lock to uncoil back at Serenia
A Sorry you are having trouble with the snake
Don't let it get to you my friend The snake puzzle worked for me the first time and every subsequent time without a second try needed
So I suspect there is a matter of understanding the process that is missing Find the lower right black stripe on the snake
Click and hold the button down on the right edge of the stripe and drag the mouse horizontally to the left over the stripe
At the left end of the stripe stop and release the mouse button
I think of it as petting the little guy but it important that you stroke right to left Do this three more times and the snake should come alive then click his head
A this is what worked for me to wake the snake up Hold down the left mouse button and stroke the bottom stripe right to left
Release the mouse button as you move your cursor left to right and depress the button again as you begin each stroke
You have to stroke fairly quickly
Also getting out of the lieft chair and getting back in after a failed attempt seemed to help reset the puzzle
A Maybe what you are missing is the release of the mouse button after you drag it right to left
I also checked where the hand cursor works best
You can put your fingertips on the stripe or the palm of the hand it works both ways
Make sure you start your stroke on the right end of the black stripe as opposed to starting off the right edge and ending the stroke while still on the left end of the stripe as opposed to running off to the left
Also don't drag too slowly it seems to miss the very slow strokes
Colored Marbles Lock Q Hi everybody I am in Serenia trying to unlock the door to the workshop I did the Dreamworld and got the colors when I turned all the spheres white I drained the hole to the door I tried the color combos every way I know how
Every time I press the button the door closes and resets the puzzle Does any one know the correct placement of the marbles I have been trying for almost days I sure do need some help
Thanks By the way this is a great Quest
A To solve the colored marble puzzle you need to find a clue in Spire
Without this clue the puzzle's pretty hopeless You'll need to make sure you've finished ALL of Spire then get a good look at the elevator there
Q I went to Spire and took a picture of the round thing hanging on the elevator That thing has a purple marble on it There is no purple on the lock that is on the door Starting from the top going clockwise I had red cyan red green purple blue The colors you get in Dreamworld are green red blue and pink yellow cyan Is this correct
A I found out by experimenting that Purple Spire Pink Serenia and that Green Green and LightGreen Yellow So the purple is easy treat it as pink on the door combo But the real question is whether you saw a green or Lightgreen on that medallion
For me it was easy because I had both Green and a LightGreen on the medallion and I figured it out ALSO The code from the medallion is different for all of us so we can't give you an absolute solution only advice
Q When I pressed the medallion and get two sets of colors for example I am getting a vision of inner blue red green one set the other is inner light blue purple yellow My question is this
Is this my combination for the door puzzle if so at the door puzzle you have triangles on the top and at the bottom you have more triangle in which direction do you start from left to right or from top to bottom For example if I am going to put inner blue green red at the left top what about the nd top and the right top are all the colors be the same or do I have to switch them around hellip and do I do the same for the bottom triangle I know how to move them A The combination STARTS with the six colors in the medallion from the elevator in Spire
Each of us got a different set of colors from the medallion
SOLUTION
Those six colors must be moved to the six positions that I have shown with a white circle around them in my screenshot
I put them in the same positions they had on the medallion
The dream world clue tells us that we have to add two colors to the triangle of each of these six colors that when blended together will form white
Blue Red Green is one combo
Yellow light blue purple pink is the second
So after you have the six colors set go to each triangle and augment with the correct additional two colors to satisfy the puzzle

THEN this is important when you have it right you must press the button at the bottom to open the door If the code is right it opens if wrong the puzzle resets bummer In the case of my screenshot see below notice the color at was Red on the medallion so I put Red there
Then I added Green and Blue to the other corners of that triangle
The color at on the medallion was Yellow actually looks light green on the medallion so I put Yellow at then added Light Blue and Pink Purple I took care in making sure that colors were always in the same order in each triangle that is Red Green Blue or Yellow Lightblue Pink going clockwise but I don't know if the game is that picky
Supporting screenshot for this answer is below A In my door puzzle I made sure that the little triangle apexes aimed toward the center of the door mirrored the colour wheel from the Spire medallion
My colours were clock wise from red green red magenta light blue and magenta
If I recall there is a memory scene which will display two colour wheels each containing three colours I think it was from the dream scene
Anyway your triplex of colours for each triangle should then reflect the colour scheme of the two colour wheels from that dream
I hope I haven't made it too confusing
When you finish with the last triangle they should all glow white
A Note that your six colors blue purple blue yellow yellow amp green must be in the positions with the white circles around them So if BLUE is at your position the two other colors in that triangle must be GREEN and RED
If PURPLE is your color at then the two remaining colors for that triangle must be LIGHTBLUE and YELLOW When you have it set properly you have to press the button bottom again
This can be painful because if it's wrong the puzzle resets and you start over again
A Just a note to others it is LIGHTgreen on the medallion that looks yellow on the door
There is also a Green darker on the medallion that will look green on the door Here's a summary of the colors avail and what they might look like on the door puzzle MEDALLION DOORLt
Green YellowLt
Blue Lt Blue Cyan Purple PinkGreen GreenBlue BlueRed Red Location of the Medallion in Spire Q I rsquo m in Serenia andI can't remember where the medallion in Spire is
How can I get back there to check the colors
A There is a linking book to Tomahna back at the spot where you first linked in here
It's on the ground
It takes you to a yet unvisited area of Tomahna so enjoy
You'll find your way back to the Spire linking book below Atrus' fireplace
The medalion will still be there on the elevator near the top assuming you haven't started working with someone else rsquo s savegame along the way
Replaying Yeesha rsquo s Memories Q Is there any way that the puzzle with Yeesha's memories and the five floating objects can bereset to the beginning
Unfortunatly I jumped the gun and messed up most the icons like I knew what I was doing and my'saved game' reflects that I sure hope I don't have to go way back because I didn rsquo t 'save' as often as I should have A I haven't experimented with it myself but I have seen other posts in other forums that have said you CAN'T reset the puzzle
So if you intend on following the ingame hints exactly save at the beginning and then save at the halfway mark ALSO
and this is a big ALSO save immediately after the dream ends and you are still in your chair
Otherwise if you want to go back and experience the ENDGAME videos you'll have to solve the memory puzzle again ugh
Serenia Map What to do if the Game Menu is Slowing Down Q It seems no matter what system you have that as the game progresses the time element for ESC
to SAVE and SAVE to EXIT and also LOAD GAME to ENTER is taking longer and longer Plus I was wondering if should be mentioned here at Boomers or future walkthroughs because some gamers have been depending on a fast ESC
to work on the slider lock puzzle in Spire and should do Spire right away because later in the game may not have that option
A I'm not sure if it's the number of saved games or the size of the saved games or both I create lot of save games and I took lots and lots of pictures with the in game camera
My save files kept getting bigger and bigger as the save file includes all the pictures you took
My last save file and I still have one age to go
was I kid you not MB
No wonder the game was loading and saving very slowly So I copied my save games files over to another folder and then I copied over a couple at a time to myst revelation savegames which is where Myst IV stores the save game files
I brought up each save file and deleted the screenshots I took one by one and I resaved each save file
Now most of the save files are small
The game seemed to be loading and saving faster but I'll have to play around with it to be sure I'm going to go submit this issue as a bug
Hindsight is a wonderful thing but perhaps if future games use an in camera there can be a better way to implement it so it doesn't affect game saves and loads Oh that is my theory of what is happening the size and number of game save files is affecting load and save
I think that's what's causing it but I don't know for sure
A I've deleted all but the last five of my save games and it has indeed made the menu system react much better
Q Could someone tell me step by step how to go into computer and delete the saved games
A You don't have to go into the computer to delete games just go to quot load quot in the options
The middle option I'm pretty sure it's the middle but it's labeled anyway is to quot delete quot so you just highlight a save and click that
There will probably be a box asking it you want to delete it I wouldn't take out all of the saves leave some so that if you have to go back you won't have to repeat huge chunks of the game Myst IV Revelation rsquo s Questers dadguy Becky Annie Adventuregamegirl bergmag charward chiefette corny Dawna Demosthenes dianne dogpenny dragonia flotsam gamenut GeeGee girlgeek gremlin Henny Tiben housewife jacqieh jayne Jeepers Jenny jerryw jhorgan joanieS katielou kjos lucinda maggiebe marty Mordack MrEno msblue mszv Pere philby puppytoes rain rockingrjranch Sequoia SKIPPIDY SOLVER syberia syd tazmanw texaslady TLC Vizagoth wysewomon copyright GameBoomers GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions

ImportantBe sure you have time enough to finish the demo
Keep in mind that you cannot save the game
So if you stop the demo before ending it you have to start from scratch again
While facing the linking portal turn to the right
Press the blue lit button next to the bridge
The gate will be opened
Cross the bridge to the very end
You'll end up facing another room with a linking portal
Alas the gate at this end of the bridge cannot be opened
Turn around and cross the bridge once more
Turn to the left and walk towards the other bridge
Now you'll meet the guy called Esher
Listen to his story
When he's finished proceed to the bridge
Press the blue lit button next to the bridge
Cross the bridge to the very end
You're facing another room with a linking portal and another dead end at the end of the bridge
Turn around and cross the bridge once more
Walk towards the linking portal
Enter the portal
Pick up the stone Slate from the linking pedestal
Press the blue lit image at the left side of the pedestal to get linked to Noloben
Make sure you take the stone Slate from the linking pedestal
Turn around and exit the linking portal
Turn to the left and notice Esher sitting on the beach in the distance
Walk towards Esher and listen to his story one more time
Walk further to the end of the beach
Turn to the left and go forward one step
Enter the cave
Keep on walking straight ahead until you end up at the other side of the island
If you like you can explore this part of the island
Notice something that looks like a closed door on one of the little islands in the sea
You can cross the water to walk to that door which turns out to be a huge rock blocking your way into the rock
In the demo there is no way to get rid of this rock as far as I know
Turn around to see some kind of building in the distance with a huge lens on the roof
I guess in the real game this lens has something to do with this rock
However there is a way to get passed this rock
Because you'll loose your stone Slate by that I'll show you how to get there at the end of this walkthrough
When you've seen enough return to the cave
You can find it by crossing the sea and walk all the way to the left
The mysterious closed door Enter the cave and walk all the way to the end until you're standing on the other beach again
Turn to the right and go forward twice
Turn to the right to face some sort of tent with a table with some empty bowls
Study the stone Slate that is laying on the ground
Look at the signs on that tablet
Now use your stone Slate to draw the same signs on the tablet
Remember that you are facing the sign on the ground up side down
The stone Slate on the ground Now make a drawing of these signs on the Slate
Because you see the signs up side down it should look like this Now is that a fine piece art or what
When finished move your cursor to the top or to the bottom of your screen to drop the stone Slate on the ground
Turn to the right and go forward twice
Turn around to see what is happening
If you made a good drawing a creature named Bahro will use the stone Slate to make it rain
When nothing happens you didn't make the correct drawing
In that case pick up the stone Slate and try again Return to the tent and notice four bowls that are surrounding a big stone
See how these bowls are getting filled with water
Wait until the rain stops with a big flash
Then have a look at the filled bowls
Notice that in each and every bowl a sign from the tapestry on the back wall will be reflected
I guess you'll recognize these four symbols as D'Ni signs
Some of the signs on the tapestry however don't look familiar at all
These must be Bahro signs Four reflected D'Ni signs It's very important to make a note of the four D'Ni signs in the bowls
It's also very important to make a note in which order these four signs in the bowls are surrounding the big stone
So after you have done that you can go on with the game
If you like you can wait until the water is drained from the bowls
Turn to the left and head back into the linking portal
Place your stone Slate on the linking pedestal
Why
Because in a short time you have to climb up a ladder and the Slate is far too heavy to take it up with you
Exit the portal
Turn to the right and walk to the ship wreck
Turn to the right and walk towards the steep cliffs
At the right side of the cliffs you'll see a cave
Enter the cave and soon your way will be blocked by a closed door
Believe me there are four of these closed door in that cave
So to get to the end of the cave you have to open these four doors
Head back to the steep cliffs
Notice the hard to see lever that is hanging down
Pull down that lever
The hard to find lever
Climb up the ladder
If you like you can examine this part of the island
While walking around you'll notice that four stone pedestals are surrounding a huge stone building
Now remember the tent with the four bowls surrounding the big stone you just saw on the beach
It's good you did make a note of the images and the correct order of them after all
When you examine the four pedestals you'll notice that you can turn the top
You'll also notice that on these tops there are these strange Bahro signs
Now the question of course is how to discover what these Bahro signs are meaning
To do so the huge building in the center of the pedestal comes in very handy
It takes quite some time to find out which D'Ni symbol represents which Bahro symbol Notice that all windows of the huge building can be closed and opened
First of all make sure that all of the windows are closed
Then open this window of which we all know it's the D'Ni sign for the roman I The first window to open Then walk to the opposite site of the building and open the opposite window
One handy tip there are windows so to go to the opposite window you have to walk past seven closed windows
When you open that window you'll see the corresponding Bahro sigh above the window you opened first
For a complete view of all the D'Ni signs and the corresponding Bahro signs havea look at this page
The Bahro sign above the opened window For this demo you only have to figure out which Bahro signs correspond with the four D'Ni signs you have seen earlier on the filled bowls When finished be sure to stand in front of the ladder you just climbed up and face the huge stone building
Go forward one step
Turn to the right and notice the stone pedestal a little further away
Walk towards that pedestal and turn to the left
Turn the top of the pedestal until it shows this image The first pedestal correctly adjusted Turn to the right and walk towards the next pedestal
Turn the top of the pedestal until it shows this image The second pedestal correctly adjusted Turn to the right and walk towards the next pedestal
Turn the top of the pedestal until it shows this image The third pedestal correctly adjusted
Turn to the right and walk towards the next pedestal
Turn the top of the pedestal until it shows this image The fourth pedestal correctly adjusted Now head back to the ladder leading down
Climb down the ladder
Turn around so you are facing the ship wreck
Go forward two steps
Turn to the left and go forward one step
Turn to the left and walk towards the cave
Enter the cave and walk all the way to the end
Be careful though
When are at the end of the cave you'll look into another room with a linking pedestal
If you enter that room the Demo will be over
So don't enter that room yet
Let's do some other things first just for fun
Turn around and walk all the way back trough the cave
Head back into the linking portal
Take the stone Slate from the pedestal
Remember Esher told you that these Bahro creatures do understand elementary signs
So let's draw the most elementary sign and see what's happening
Draw a big circle on the Slate surrounded by four little circles
So in fact the same as the bowls surrounding the big stone in the tent and the four pedestals surrounding the huge stone building on top of the cliffs
It should look like this Hmmm another very fine piece of art Drop the Slate on the ground and exit the portal
Go to the left and walk away
When you hear a sound turn around and notice that a Bahro is admiring your piece of art and takes off once more
Enter the portal and notice that this stupid Bahro has gone including the stone Slate
Also notice that this Bahro added a linking sign at the right side of the pedestal
The new linking sign Press this new sign to end up behind the huge rock on the little island
You can walk around the linking portal if you like
Nothing else to do right now
So enter the linking portal
Click on the Slate to activate it
To get linked back to Noloben click below the stone Slate
Now you can enter the cave near the steep cliffs once more walk all the way to the end en enter the room with the linking pedestal to end the Demo GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions

Let's do some other things first just for fun
Turn around and walk all the way back trough the cave
Head back into the linking portal
Take the stone Slate from the pedestal
Remember Esher told you that these Bahro creatures do understand elementary signs
So let's draw the most elementary sign and see what's happening
Draw a big circle on the Slate surrounded by four little circles
So in fact the same as the bowls surrounding the big stone in the tent and the four pedestals surrounding the huge stone building on top of the cliffs
It should look like this Hmmm another very fine piece of art Drop the Slate on the ground and exit the portal
Go to the left and walk away
When you hear a sound turn around and notice that a Bahro is admiring your piece of art and takes off once more
Enter the portal and notice that this stupid Bahro has gone including the stone Slate
Also notice that this Bahro added a linking sign at the right side of the pedestal
The new linking sign Press this new sign to end up behind the huge rock on the little island
You can walk around the linking portal if you like
Nothing else to do right now
So enter the linking portal
Click on the Slate to activate it
To get linked back to Noloben click below the stone Slate
Now you can enter the cave near the steep cliffs once more walk all the way to the end en enter the room with the linking pedestal to end the Demo GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions

Thanks go to Gene for finding this one Will post questions as I come across them D Walkthrough Hello
Coelho Buda here or for those familiar with the Guild of Greeters Rabbit
Welcome to my latest and probably last walkthrough
Myst V End ofAges brings closure to a project that started in
Now the journey comesto a full circle and promises us an amazing ride
Myst V is a full immersive D environment that can be played in three modes classic for those who likethe feeling of the first Myst free move for those who prefer a URU feeling and a mix of both As always and as in my previous walkthroughs any contributions will be gladlyaccepted and can be sent to my e mail Warning This walkthrough contains major spoilers
It could seriously affectyour enjoyment of the game
I do not give out hints or nudges
I simply statehow a given puzzle should be solved
That said read on at your own risk So without further ado on to the game itself
K'veer The game begins on a very sad note
You can hear the weariness and sadness inAtrus' voice as he speaks
You're treated to a review of what has gone beforeand a foreshadowing of what is to come
Pay attention to what is said becausethere are many important hints throughout it
Once the speech ends you'llappear in the first of the game's Ages K'veer Take a moment to adjust the game settings to your comfort and when you'reready let us proceed
The room you are in was Atrus' prison for those of younot familiar with the Myst universe
There are some Bahro around but theyrun away when you appear here
There are also frequent tremors that make thewhole building you're in shake The room is empty except for a desk to the left of your starting point
Onthis desk you will find a bound book with the title Myst
You can pick it upto examine but it's impossible to do anything else to it now
Turn around andapproach the door that was in front of you when you linked in Examine the right side closely and you will find a handle
Click on it to openthe door
Exit this room and proceed down the stairs to the left
Go past thehall and down some more stairs until you find a lamp with a blue fire marble Collect your journal which will allow you to take notes and store pictures and the camera
The camera allows you to take pictures
Each picture you takealso works as a save point
You can also write some notes below each pictureso that you know what you were doing when you left the game last time Enter the opening in front of you and you'll exit below a staircase into alarge chamber with a link bubble
The inside of the bubble flashes from timeto time showing you different Ages
Enter the bubble to find the Tablet
TheTablet is secured to a pedestal by four clamps the freeing of which will bethe object of the game well one of the objects
Touch the Tablet to have itrespond to you
When the game lets you exit the bubble As you do Yeesha will link in behind you and talk to you
Listen to herspeech carefully
Particularly note that she doesn't want you to give theTablet to her when you free it and that she says she can't hold it any longer This will be very important at the end of the game
Yeesha sounds veryembittered and somewhat disturbed So now you know what you have to do collect what has been scattered returnit to this pedestal and free the Tablet
When Yeesha tells you to begin you'll be linked to a different Age known as the Cleft for those who haveplayed URU
Cleft the Great Shaft and Direbo You'll be greeted by Esher a D'ni
Listen to his speech which is also filledwith important hints and notice that Esher doesn't like Yeesha very much
Hesounds a little bit arrogant and patronizing
Throughout the game he willappear at key points and tell you things that you need to know or do in orderto proceed
That doesn't mean you have to like him
You will also come to knowhis true nature as you progress through the Ages When he leaves and you're free to move take a look around
Examine thedrawings that recount the family history notice the huge stone dagger fromRiven and the hole filled with water in the middle of the area you're in You're at the top of the volcano that leads to D'ni To the left of the dagger when facing it is a big boulder without drawings Go behind it to find a hole
Climb down the hole to arrive at a cave thatleads to the first of the rest areas
There are some a Bahro in here
Crossthe cave and exit to a tunnel on the other side In front of you there's a crate with a lamp on it and the first of Yeesha'sjournals
Pick it up and Yeesha's voice will read it for you
These journalshelp you establish what has happened to Yeesha as well as showing you themental state she is in
There are twelve of them and you will collect them allbefore leaving this Age
They will be stored along with your Journal cameraand book with Esher and Yeesha speeches on the options bar that can be pulleddown from the upper right section of the game window To the right of the crate further along the tunnel there's another journalnear a yellow lamp
Go pick it up and read it
Continue forward until youarrive at the opening on the wall
Use it to enter the first of the restareas When you enter it you'll see an Imager to your left that contains a recordingfrom Yeesha
Press the blue button to hear it
She is quite angry in it There's also a drawing of the Great Shaft on a cot opposite the entrance abroken KI dispenser the KI is a reference to URU and won't be used in thisgame at all and a pedestal with a link book that leads to a nexus Age calledDirebo I call it a nexus because this Age is used merely to link to all the others Link there
Esher will be there and give another speech
He'll call Direbo arest Age and talk about the pedestal the slate and the Bahro
He will alsotell you to touch the pedestal and come to Taghira the first Age
Do not dothis yet
Once you have done the Great Shaft completely you'll do the Agesone by one NOTE a small note on sequence the Ages can be done in whatever sequence youlike as they are all independent from each other with a small exception there's one hint in one of Esher's speeches given in Noloben that will helpout in Laki'ahn
I chose to do them in the order listed in the link books ofDirebo that is Taghira Todelmer Noloben and Laki'ahn When he finishes the speech turn around go to one of the gated bridges andopen it by pressing the blue button on the post
The fire marble swings aroundand goes from blue to yellow
Do the same at the other gate
Don't bother tocross the bridges yet as they're both locked at the ends
When this is done link back to the rest area In the middle of the room there is another cot with Yeesha's third journal Pick it up and read it
When you're done exploring this area go out to thetunnel and go past the crate On your right you'll see some D'ni writing and two D'ni numbers and Copy them to a piece of paper
These will become important in another Age Past the numbers there's an opening on the wall that leads to a large chamber Enter it
To the right there's a door with a broken switch by it
When you tryto cross the room to the other side Esher will appear and tell you a bit moreof his history and that you need to open the door Before you do though continue across the room to the cul de sac at the otherend and pick Yeesha's fourth journal by the lamp
Return to the main room andapproach the door Esher told you
Use the switch lever by it switch it to theright to open it up
Exit through this door to a tunnel Cross the tunnel to arrive at the Great Shaft
Don't bother following thespiral path to your left down because it is broken and won't let you get tothe bottom
Go to the right and Esher will appear and deliver another of hisspeeches
This one is about Ti'ana Yeesha's great grandmother
He also talksabout another rest area that has another link book to Direbo Continue up a small stair and turn left
Pull the leaver toward you to releasea counterweight and make an elevator come up
Step into it pull the handleand enjoy the ride down
Exit the elevator and proceed around the left to therest area
Enter it Inside you'll find Yeesha's fifth journal atop a cot on the wall anotherbroken KI dispenser and another link book to Direbo
Link there and open thegates as you did for the first island
You can now walk from Direbo island twoto Direbo island one
The island numbers are the D'ni symbols you see on eachlink book to Direbo
When this is done link back to the Great Shaft Exit the rest area and continue to the left until you arrive at a secondelevator
To the left of the elevator there's another lever with Yeesha'ssixth journal by it
Pick it up and read it
When done pull the lever to theleft of it to release a counterweight
Wait for the elevator to come up
Stepinto it and pull the handle to go down Exit the elevator and climb down a carpeted stairway to the left
At thebottom Esher will tell you about the Shaft and to raise the floor and powerthe fans to provide you with fresh air so you can enter the tunnels below Unfortunately I have found no way of visiting the tunnels below in spite ofthe raised floor and working fans Anyway once the speech ends continue forward and enter the opening on theleft
You can see a Bahro down there
Follow it down to the right until youget to a room with a machine that has a blue button on it
This is part of thepuzzle to raise the floor
The machine works on a timer so don't press theblue button just now
First let us find the other machine
Once you get yourbearings and know where the buttons are we will return here
Before you gothough pick up Yeesha's seventh journal from the floor and read it Exit to the right or left as both lead to the same room
This is the bottom ofthe Great Shaft
Notice a raised cylinder in the centre of the room with abutton atop it painted in red with a D'ni symbol
This button will only workafter you have pressed the other two so for now leave it as is
Continueacross the room and exit through the opposite wall Follow the stairs to another timer machine
This one has a yellow button
Nowthat you know where all the buttons and machines are you can raise the floor Remember that you will be on a timer so try to do it as quick as possible although the time given is more than enough to perform the task Press the yellow button and exit the room to the bottom of the Great Shaft Cross to the other side go up the stairs and press the blue button
Return tothe bottom of the Great Shaft and press the button on top of the raisedcylinder in the middle of the room
Now relax and wait for the ride to end Once at the top make your way to a previously impossible to get to opening somewhat opposite the opening that led to the room with the Bahro
Enter itand you will see Yeesha's eighth journal on the floor to the right below amachine
Move the switch lever on this machine to the left to power the firstof the fans Turn to the left and cross the door that leads to yet another rest area
Thisone contains an imager with a recording from Yeesha which you can listen to bypressing the blue button on it
There's also another link book to Direbo thethird one that leads to island three
As before link there open the gatesand link back here
You now have access to three Ages Taghira Todelmer andNoloben
Only one more to go Return to the elevated floor and press the button to go down
When the floorcomes to a rest get ready to make it go up again
Only this time you won't goup with it
Go to the room with the blue button and press it
Cross the GreatShaft to the other side and go to the room with the yellow button
Press thisone and return to the Great Shaft
Press the red button and back away from thesection of the floor that rises up Note Steffen Beyer sent me an email saying that instead of doing this againto raise the floor exiting the game to the desktop and running it again don't forget to choose continue will produce the same effect
If you don'tmind the wasted time with reloading the game it might work for you Once you can do it approach the pit in the middle of the Shaft and find aladder to climb down there are three on the inner wall of the pit
Make yourway to the centre and pick up Yeesha's ninth journal
Do not bother with thebutton here as it makes the raised floor come down
Find the wall that hasn'tgot a ladder on it
This one has an opening to a tunnel that ends at anotherfan control
Turn the switch lever to the left to power this fan
Now that thefloor is raised and the fans are working you'll have access to the last ofthe four Ages
All you have to do now is find the fourth rest area Turn around and start walking down the tunnel
You'll notice that a serviceladder has dropped from the ceiling
Climb it to another tunnel section
Atthe top turn to the left and go to the closed door
Yeesha's tenth journal isby the switch lever that controls this door
Pick the journal and open thedoor by throwing the switch lever to the right
The opening leads to the GreatShaft Instead of going through it turn around and go along the tunnel to the otherend
Enter another big chamber with a door to your right and another to theleft
Supposedly the door on the right leads to D'ni but the switch lever ismissing so there's no way of opening it
Near this missing switch lever you'llfind Yeesha's eleventh journal Go through the other door to find the fourth rest area
This area has anotherimager with one Yeesha recording a broken KI dispenser the twelfth Yeeshajournal on a cot in the wall and the link book to Direbo island number four Pick the journal read it and listen to the recording
By now you should havea pretty good idea of what is going on with Yeesha and also many hints andclues about what to do at the end But first things first link to Direbo and open both bridges
Also say goodbyeto the Great Shaft as we won't be returning here
You are now ready to startsolving the puzzles present in the four Ages
Island number four holds thebubble that links to Laki'ahn the fourth Age Still in Direbo make your way to island number one you can see the numbersby looking to the link books in each island and enter the link bubble there Inside there's a pedestal with a slate on it
This slate has a sort of houseshaped contour
You'll see that each slate has a unique shape This slate will be used on our journey through Taghira
Pick the slate byclicking on it
Notice that the slate is now represented at the bottom left ofthe screen
It will be used to draw symbols and ask for the assistance of theBahro Note On the use of the slates The slate has two spaces on the left side one that has two lines crossing used to erase the slate and one that is currently empty
This one will beused for storing an Age special Bahro action
On the right side of the slatethere are more empty spaces that will be used to store Age specific linklocations
You will come across these symbols as you explore each Age
I hopeyou are good at drawing because the Bahro are sometimes very picky at the waya drawing is made To use a slate you draw a symbol and drop the slate on the floor
When youback away a Bahro will link in look at the slate and perform an actionaccording to what is drawn on the slate
If he doesn't understand the drawingor the slate is dropped with nothing on it the Bahro will return the slate tothe starting point of the Age useful sometimes Take a look at the pedestal
Now that you've removed the slate there's asymbol for the shape of the slate that was there
Below the space the slateoccupied there is also Direbo's Age symbol which looks like three trees threerectangles with a line coming out at the bottom of each sprouting from asemicircle
This symbol is currently unlit which means you can't use it tolink
To the left of this symbol is a smaller version of the slate contour which is lit
Press it to link to Taghira
Taghira Welcome to snowy Taghira
I consider this one of the beautiful Ages of Myst When you link in and exit the bubble Esher will be there to give you anotherspeech
He talks about the burden that is the slate and that you shouldrelease it
He also says that Taghira is a prison Age
To prove him right youjust have to walk around after he leaves and realize that there's no wayout Approach the tunnel in front of the link bubble and you'll hear a sound likeice cracking
If you look down you'll see a drawing that closely resembles theslate you are now holding
Remember Esher's words about releasing the burdenand using the slate to set you free
Drop the slate here and the floor willcrack
A Bahro will link in and take the slate back to the pedestal inside thelink bubble this will only happen once you step away from the bubble
Retrieve the slate and head to the cracked ice
You will fall through and gainyour freedom
Go outside and look up
In front of you there's a wooden ladder and on the wall above it a symbol
This one looks like the upper half of aspoke wheel with three spokes or a sun symbol if you prefer
If you drawthis symbol on the slate drop it and step away a Bahro will appear andperform their special action for this Age which is turning up the heat Notice the steam rising from the ground up there Also notice that the empty left space on the slate now holds the sun symbol From now on whenever you need to use it just press this symbol and the gamewill repeat your drawing
Very handy feature If you try to climb the ladder with the slate you'll find that you can't Going around and up the snowy path to the left of the entrance with your backto it will also prove impossible as the game won't let you jump down
So drop down the slate and climb the wooden ladder
A Bahro will take the slateto the starting pedestal Once up there approach the pedestal and copy the drawing there to a piece ofpaper
This one looks like a ship anchor the bottom half of a semicircle witha vertical line perpendicular to it
When you're done press the slate symbolon the pedestal to link to the starting pedestal
Retrieve the slate stepoutside of the bubble draw the anchor symbol and drop the slate
Step awayand this time the Bahro will take the slate to the proper pedestal Make your way there by once more falling down the hole exiting to thecourtyard and climbing the wooden ladder
Retrieve the slate from thispedestal
If you examine the slate now you'll see that a new symbol has beenadded to the right empty spaces and that there are three more empty spaces That means you'll have to find three more symbols
Continue through the bridgeto the right Once on the other side keep going forward until you reach a village
As youapproach the grassy mound in front of you you'll see the second pedestal forthis Age
This symbol looks like a hut with an antenna and a small verticalline inside it or a light bulb resistance
Draw it on the slate and drop it Step away and let the Bahro place the slate on the pedestal
This will giveyou a new symbol on the slate as well as freeing your hands for other tasksthat you'll have to perform shortly Advance towards the hut in front of you
When you're almost at the top Esherwill link in and perform another speech
This one is about the prisoners ofTaghira and the transitional quality of existence how deeply philosophical When he finishes proceed to the hut and enter it
Inside you'll find a mapwith red circles and blue circles
I'll try to reproduce it as best as I canwith ASCII characters O O O Where pipe curveO red junction blue junctionExit the hut go down stairs and to the back of it via the left side
On yourway there notice where three large pipes meet and sink into the floor
Thesepipes have three switches with red screws near them
Each switch can be set toa right centre or left position
Opposite this station there is anotherstation with three pipes but these have blue screws
As you can't do anythingto them now proceed to the lake You can't cross it because it's frozen but the lay out of the pipes is thesame as the map inside the hut
Come back to the hut with the map and climbthe slope to the left with the hut behind you
Esher will appear at the topand explain about the life present in the water of this Age and how it cravesit
He also tells you that you can make the Bahro bring the heat to you Now to save you a bit of going back and forth I'll explain what you have todo
Summoning the heat will cause steam to form and be transmitted to thepipes allowing you to operate the red and blue switches which will in turntransport heat to the lake where the organisms present in the water will forma bridge allowing you to cross to the other side
However in order for thesteam to reach the red and blue stations you have to go to each of the hutlike structures and turn all six of the switch levers from left to right
Doso now one in the structure by the central hut three in the ones on theright slope and two on the ones to the left of the hut when facing it After this is done go to one of the stations and use the slate to call forheat
Once there is steam in the pipes the switches in the station will riseup and let you set them to a position
What you need to make sure is that youcan make the organisms create a path as big as possible Look at the map above
Each switch will determine if steam flows to the rightor to the left when it comes to a junction
In the case of the red switchesyou want to set them to from left to right left position right positionand left position which will make the steam go up then right and then up For the blue station following the same reasoning set the switches left toright like so right position left position left position So now that you know what you need to do go pick up the slate and approachone of the stations
Call the symbol for heat and drop the slate
Back awayand let the Bahro do his thing
Pick the slate approach the station and setthe switches
Before the steam runs out go to the other station and do thesame Now if you're fast you can still run to the lake and traverse the organicpath to the other side
Be careful not to fall into the water or you'll haveto restart the path
There is only one point where you can exit the path ontothe ice on the other side
You can see it as a small tongue of ice thatreaches close to the path on the upper left side of the lake If you're not able to cross it before the steam runs out just ask the Bahroagain for some steam and cross the lake afterwards
Once on the other side Esher will give a speech about the tombs of the D'ni
He finishes by tellingyou to make Bahro bring you to the keep as it will run from you
When heleaves approach the pedestal on the left
Copy the symbol to the slate
Thisone looks like a person with a zipped up jacket
Drop the slate back away andlet the Bahro take the slate to the pedestal You know have three of the four symbols for this Age
Only the last one to goto let you link to the Keep
Approach the link bubble on the end and it willfloat away from you
You can still make out the symbol on the pedestal so tryto draw it as best as possible
It is made of two horizontal rectangles unitedby two vertical small lines
Try to draw the rectangles as big as you can
Ifyou look around you you'll see the drawing resembles the tombs
Try to get itas close to a tomb as possible
Drop the slate back away and wait for theBahro to link the slate to the bubble If it didn't work that is if you don't see the Bahro linking to the Keep pick the slate again and try a new drawing
Once it works go to the pedestalwith the third symbol and use the lit slate symbol to link to the start of theAge
On the rim of the pedestal there should be all of the Age's symbols Press the tomb one to link to the Keep at the end Once you link there Esher will explain about the Keep and that it exists atmany places at the same time
When the speech ends enter the Keep press theslate from Taghira to release the first clamp and to finish this Age
Click onthe lit slate symbol for this Age to link to the start and once there clickon Direbo's lit symbol the three trees on a mound to link there After you arrive on Direbo go to island number two
Enter the bubble there pick the slate this one has an inverted diamond shape and touch the litslate symbol on the pedestal to link to Todelmer
Todelmer Whoa
Can I just say wow
This Age blew me away
It reminded me a bit ofAhnonay's space version but this one is much more beautiful
Take a look atthe scenery and when you're ready follow the path to the left until you meetEsher in a red room filled with machinery
He'll talk about how Todelmer wasbuilt to study the heavens and that they were never allowed to finish it He'll also advance a bit more on D'ni history and Yeesha Once he leaves go around the dais to the right and find your way to the veryback of the chamber
You will find some kind of large porthole window with twolevers below it
One moves up and down and the other moves left and right This is a power switch and the trick here is to make the light from the windowbecome has bright as possible
Roughly you need to set the left lever to themiddle position and the right lever to the right
You'll know you have theright spot when the rim starts to spin Once you've powered this machine return to the entrance and climb the dais Go to the right and all the way to the back
Turn left to an out of ordertelescope viewer it shows static on the monitor
What you will do here isset some coordinates so that some cables that are blocking the path up to thetop of the spire are lifted out of the way
Since this is the only telescopethat isn't working it follows that the fallen cables belong to it Remember those D'ni numbers you found on a wall back in the Great Shaft
Itold you they'd be important and asked you to copy them
Set them on thetelescope by using the left slider and the top slider on the control panel For the left slider zero is at the bottom and for the top slider zero is onthe left
Set the left slider to the D'ni number and the top slider to theD'ni number
Press the green flashing button to set the coordinates Exit the red room and proceed to the left up two stone stairways and then ametal stairway
Once at the top you'll now see the broken cables hanging fromthe air and the passage is now passable
Continue to the very top of thespire
Once at the top you'll find a lot of structures and a telescope to yourright
Before you do anything with it proceed to the right and find the domewith an open door
Enter the room beyond and proceed to the back where there'sa map on the wall Take a look at the map four red 'pac man' symbols connected by lines to a bigblue cross circle two other blue cross circles and a green line connectingtwo of the blue cross circles
This is a map of the Age
The 'pac man' symbolsrepresent the four big telescopes the blue circles represent the smallertelescopes and the green line represents a tram that you will have to ride atsome point in this Age For now turn around and return to the door
Close it by pressing the whitebutton
Another white button is revealed behind the door
Press this one alsoto activate a secret stairway behind you
Climb down it
At the bottom you'llfind an access to the tram
There are two levers on the right
The top onecontrols the tram travel direction and the bottom one controls the movement Make sure the top one is pushed to the right when facing it and pull thebottom lever down once
This will make a big gear upstairs spin and allow youto see the second pedestal symbol Go back up the stairs and out of the dome
Remember to leave the secretstairway open so that you can move freely
Make your way to small telescope Imentioned when you arrived up here
Click on the lens to sit down and use it The telescope has three controls a slider on the left that makes it tilt upor down a slider on the right that makes it swivel left and right and a lever also on the right side that allows you to zoom in and out If you didn't mess around with the telescope before it should be aimed at aspire
Use the zoom control to zoom in
Notice the 'pac man' symbol with a setof D'ni numbers to the right of it
Adjust the telescope so you can betterview the symbols on the spire
Copy them to a piece of paper and you'll haveyour first set of coordinates for the machines in the red room the numbersshown are and
This set is for the machine that shows the firstquadrant of the sky upper right section missing on the circle Move the telescope to the left until you are looking between two curving uparches and zoom in
You'll be looking through the space between two spokes ofa big gear and will see another small telescope in the distance as long asyou moved the tram downstairs once
Adjust the view until you are able to seethe first of this Age's pedestals to the left of that telescope
The symbolon it resembles three circles uniting through three concurrent lines into asingle circle on top or a meteor shower well sort of
Get out of thistelescope Enter the dome go down the stairs and make your way to the tram controls Push the upper lever to the left and pull the bottom lever down once
Thiswill set the tram on the right position for you to be able to access it fromthe other side
Now make your way to the top of the dome and exit
Draw thesymbol for the first pedestal on the slate and drop it
Back away and let theBahro link the slate to the pedestal If you want check through the telescope to make sure that the slate is nowthere
Whether it is or not you need to make your way back to the start ofthe Age so that you can link from the starting location to the first pedestal If when you arrive at the start bubble you find the slate on the pedestal you have to retry the drawing as the Bahro didn't understand it
If the symbolis on the lower rim of the pedestal touch it to link there Once on this new spire pick up the slate and then go to the telescope
Thisone you need to swivel to the right until you can see the same spire you sawfrom the other telescope
Once you have it centred zoom in to discover thesecond set of coordinates for the fourth quadrant viewer bottom right sectionis missing
They are above the door for the red room
The D'ni numbers forthis one are and
When you're done go to the pedestal and link to thestart of the Age Go to the red room and set the coordinates for both viewers the closest oneson the left and on the right
Don't forget to press the green button
Youneed to do this so that you can see the symbol for the second of the Age'spedestals which is obscured from view by the gears that command one of the bigtelescopes
Now go back to the start and link to the first pedestal Go to the small telescope and swivel it to the left pull left bottom leverdown so that the big telescope comes into view
Aim at a circular openingabove the pulsating red light in the centre of the big telescope and if youzoom in you should see the symbol for the second pedestal
It kind of lookslike a magnifying lens with the handle at the NE position and a lollypop withthe stick on the bottom overlapping each other I know my descriptions aren'tvery good but this is a text only walkthrough so bear with me Exit the telescope draw the symbol on the slate drop it
Let the Bahro takethe slate to the second pedestal and use the pedestal here to link to thestarting location
Press the lit symbol there to link to the second pedestal Once there do not pick the slate
Move towards the dome and Esher will appearto deliver another speech
He says your destiny lies above and that you haveto make the Bahro help you reach it
You cannot open the door to the dome because there's no power on this spire yet Return to the pedestal and follow the stone stairway down
Ignore thetelescope here as it won't show you anything of use
Approach the tram andclimb down into it if you have the slate with you you won't be able to climbinto the tram
Once in the tram exit towards the open doorway and climb thestairs to the back
You will find another window power machine that you'llneed to turn on to provide power to this spire
Set the left lever so that theknob almost lines up with the horizontal bar and the right lever a bit offcentre to the right
When the rim starts to spin power is on Climb the stairs all the way up and press the white button on the doorway tomake the secret stairway appear
Climb it to the top to find the specialaction symbol for this Age which looks like an inverted T with two circles the left one is set higher than the right one and the vertical line separatesthem
Copy this to a piece of paper
Behind you at the back of the roomthere's the same map that was on the first dome Exit the dome by opening the door and go pick up the slate at the pedestal Retrace your steps now with the slate back to the tram
Enter it and pullthe lever to start the ride
When the tram stops halfway copy the coordinatesfor the third quadrant viewer bottom left section is missing and notice thestylized planet above the coordinates
This is a hint for another puzzle
Thenumbers for these coordinates are and
When you are ready pull the leveragain to finish the ride When the ride ends exit to the platform climb up and out of the dome and makeyour way down the spire to the red room
Approach the farthest machine on theleft and enter the third set of coordinates there
If you use the zoom buttons top right of the viewer you should be able to see a bit of the planet
Now time to do some magic
The leftmost one is the farthest zoom and the rightmostone is the closest Esher said to make the Bahro help you so draw the special action symbol anduse it the inverted T with two circles symbol
Time will go back and theplanetary alignment will shift
The objective here is to get the rings aroundthe planet perfectly vertical just like the drawing you saw with the thirdset of coordinates
Use the symbol twice and that should do it You can check the position of the planet rings by clicking on the leftmost andmiddle button and compare it with the planet drawing
When it looks like theplanet drawing you saw earlier press the rightmost zoom button of the viewerand you should see the final pedestal and the corresponding final symbol
Thisone looks like two circles a smaller one inside a bigger one and a thirdsmall circle drawn at the NE position on the outside bigger circle
Draw it onthe slate drop it let the Bahro link away and go to the link bubble at thestart of the Age
Press the third symbol on the rim to link to the Keep Once there Esher will give another speech
This one is about the power of theTablet
He'll say that the first half of the journey is complete and that thedecision approaches
When he finishes climb down the metal ladder to find theTablet bubble below you
Enter it and touch the slate for this Age
The clampwill be released
Press the slate lit symbol to link to the start of theTodelmer
Once there press the Direbo symbol to link out and concludeTodelmer Once in Direbo make your way to island number three and enter the linkbubble
Pick up the slate this one is like a rectangle but with a roundedtop and press the lit slate symbol on the pedestal to link to Noloben
Noloben Ah sweet sandy and grassy Noloben
This is one of my favourite Ages of Mystif only because of the grass atop the isle
That and the sky's colour
Justlook at that yellow sun and those stormy clouds Exit the link bubble and make your way to the left of the beach
Here you'llfind Esher who will give another speech
This one is about Noloben
He saysit's his Age
This was also the Bahro's home and they didn't like it whenEsher came here
Funny enough I wouldn't like if Esher came to my house acting like he owned the place
But that's just me When he links out continue to the left and you'll find a small stall with acurious display of symbols on the wall behind it
The upper cloth has fourholes in it and on the stall there are four recipients surrounding what seemsto be a large stone egg
On the ground there's a slate with three circles Each circle has a vertical line sprouting down from it it looks like threelollypops If you examine the slate on the ground you'll see it's very much like the oneyou're carrying shape wise that is only that it's upside down
This meansthat the symbol also is upside down
If you turn it right side up the threelollypops become three raindrops
This is the special Bahro action for thisAge to summon rain Copy the symbol to your slate drop it and step away
Let the Bahro summonthe rain and when he is gone approach the stall
Notice that the recipientsare filling up with water
When the rain stops and when the sun comes out copy the symbols reflected on the water to a piece of paper maintaining theirrelative positions
This is essential to solving the next puzzle I'll try to describe them as best as I can Top left two vertical lines crossed by two horizontal lines Top right double circle crossed by two vertical lines Bottom left single circle crossed by two vertical lines and twohorizontal lines Bottom right two vertical linesOnce you have these go to the left past the link bubble and stop when youarrive at a drying fish station or those could be hanging shells
Turnaround and spot the molehills on the ground
Drop the slate here
Don't worry the Bahro won't pick it up
This is another clue to something you'll find outsoon they Bahro are terrified of snakes
You have to drop the slate or youwon't be able to climb up the ladder Look up and you'll see a rope hanging down
Pull it to release a ladder
Climbup and go forward to the large egg shaped structure
This structure Esher'slaboratory as you'll soon find out acts as a Rosetta stone letting youtranslate the symbols from the beach into their equivalent for the fourrotating stones that control the doors to Esher's laboratory First off I'd like you to go around the structure and close all the windowsthat are open
This will help you identify the symbols you need more easily The symbols from the beach are on the inside and the symbols for the stonesare on the outside of the windows
Each symbol on the inside corresponds tothe symbol on the outside of the same window
Pick a window and try to see ifyou can find one of the symbols from beach
When you find it leave thatwindow open go to the corresponding window on the other side and open it Then return to the first window to make sure you have opened the right window If it is indeed the right window return to it close it and take note of thesymbol on it
Do this for all four symbols or to save you the trouble hereare the correspondences using the numbers from above three horizontal lines circle with vertical line power symbol on a remote control two vertical lines crossed by a horizontal one at the bottom two horizontal rows with three square dots eachNow to help you out find the window that has a circle with a dot on thecentre and the ladder to the beach should be behind you
This will help youout identify each of the rotating stones
To find out which symbol goes toeach rotating stone I went to each of the stones and wrote down each of thesymbols present there
If you're facing the window with the circle and thedot the rotating stone to north east of you is the only one that has thepower symbol
So based on that one and on the relative positions of the othersymbols set the rotating stones like so NE circle with vertical line power symbol on a remote control NW three horizontal linesSW two vertical lines crossed by a horizontal one at the bottomSE two horizontal rows with three square dots eachTo set a rotating stone rotate the top half so that the symbol you want linesup with the line drawing on the flat face of the rotating stone
When this isdone return down to the beach
Pick up the slate and stay close to the wallon the left
Follow it until you get to a nook with an entrance to a passage The passage leads to Esher's laboratory and if you set the rotating stonesabove correctly you should have no problem getting there
Notice that thereare a lot of snakes slithering around the ground here Once you arrive at the laboratory you will see the first pedestal for theAge sporting a symbol that reminds of a dynamite detonator only this one hasa small vertical line on the bottom too
Copy it to the slate
If you drop itand back away no Bahro will come to collect it
Climb the stairs to the rightand Esher will appear
He'll explain why the Bahro won't come here the snakesbind them and prevent them from linking
He reveals his sadistic naturedisguised as a quest for knowledge as well as trying to plant more suspiciontowards Yeesha and the Bahro
He asks you to go to the top of the refuge butto do so you have to seal the refuge that is close the doors again Don't bother climb all the way to the top just not
The ladder that will allowto get outside once at the top is inaccessible for now
Pick up the slate andexit the laboratory to the beach
Draw the symbol for the first pedestal anddrop the slate
The Bahro will come touch it as if to link in and leave theslate where it is
Pick it up and check to see if the symbol has been added tothe empty spaces on the right
If it has pick up the slate head to thelaboratory again and place the slate on the pedestal
You need to do this sothat the new symbol appears on the main pedestal inside the link bubble
Pickup the slate again Go outside and check on the pedestal inside the bubble
If the symbol isthere you are ready to proceed
Go to the ladder to the upper reaches andclimb it remember to drop the slate near the ladder so you can climb
Go toeach of the rotating stones and make them move so that the four symbols youpreviously set them too are no longer set
This will close the laboratory Climb down pick the slate and go to the link bubble
Leave the slate on thepedestal here
Use the symbol for the pedestal to link to the inside of thelaboratory Climb the stone stairs up to the wooden platform
At the top go around theplatform until you see a wooden ladder leading up and an easel in front ofyou
Approach the easel to find several anatomical studies on the Bahroperformed by Esher
You will also find a slate symbol with a wavy line
Thisis the snake symbol that Esher talked about
It will allow you to performcertain actions that require a Bahro to stand on a given spot for a bit longerthan usual When you're done with the easel turn around and climb the wooden ladder
Atthe top go to the cage and use the double ladder on its face to climb atopit
At the top of the cage climb the now accessible wooden ladder and exit tothe top of the Laboratory
You'll come out in front of the second pedestal forNoloben
Copy the symbol to a piece of paper
This one is made of two circleswith two small horizontal lines coming out of the mid section of the outercircle or someone with a Mexican hat holding a pole Turn around and on the other side there's a viewer with a drawing on theground
If you stand on the drawing you'll see a door opening on a tree Inside is the Keep bubble
This is where you're going to have to use the snakesymbol because the door only remains open as long as someone is standing onthe drawing
But first you need to get the slate here Return to the pedestal and press the lit small slate symbol to link to thestart of the Age
Once there pick the slate
Exit the bubble draw the secondpedestal symbol on it and step away
Let the Bahro link away with the slate Enter the bubble and use the second pedestal lit symbol to link there
Pick upthe slate and draw the snake symbol Now once you drop the slate with the snake symbol on top of the drawing onthe floor you'll have to be fast
The Bahro will link in but he won't pickthe slate until the snake symbol disappears
This will give you time to linkto the start bubble and from there make your way to the Tree where the Keepbubble is traversing a tunnel to get there
As soon as the symbol disappearsfrom the slate the Bahro will pick it up standing on the drawing on thefloor and at the same time opening the door for you When you're ready drop the slate on the drawing turn around and use thepedestal to link to the starting bubble
From there turn around exit to theleft and proceed past the stall where you found the rain symbol
Continuealong the beach until you see an entrance into the wall on the left
Enter thetunnel and cross to the other side
On exiting the tunnel continue to theleft until you are facing the tree door you should see it across the water If you're in front of the door it's possible to cross the water to the otherside
Once there wait for the door to dissolve allowing you entry into theTree and Keep bubble Now copy the symbol here to a piece of paper
This one is made of a largecentre circle surrounded by four small ones at the NW NE SE and SWpositions
Once you have the drawing return to the start bubble by pressingthe small lit slate symbol on the clamp inside the Keep bubble Pick the slate exit the bubble draw the Keep symbol and drop the slate
Waitfor the Bahro to link away with the slate and then enter the start bubble Press the lit Keep symbol which should now be on the rim and you'll link tothe Keep
When you arrive there Esher will give another of his speeches
Thisone is about distrust particular the one he thinks you feel for him
In mycase he's right I wouldn't trust him farther than I can sneeze He will talk about another option at the end the possibility of taking theslate to Myst as Yeesha won't follow you there
When the speech end enterthe Keep bubble and touch the slate on the pedestal to release the third clampfrom the Tablet
Once this is done link to the start bubble and from therelink to Direbo Cross the bridge to island four and get ready for the final Age Laki'ahn Enter the bubble pick the slate this one has a round shape and press thesmall lit slate symbol on the pedestal to link to Laki'ahn
Laki'ahn Ah Lakhi'ahn of the sandy beaches this Age would make for a fineresort SPA
Just look at that water
Doesn't it make you want to dive in
Thered butterflies the swaying palm trees it's just beautiful
But let's getback to the game Looking around you'll see that Esher is waiting for you at the top of a smallstair in front of what he'll call a Trade house
Go to him and listen to thespeech
He'll muse over Laki'ahn as it was and paint a rather bloody and goryimage of it
He'll also say that this door is locked but the Jeweller's dooron the other side can be unlocked When he links out approach the window on the left and peer inside
There's astrip of paper with geometric figures on it on top of a table weaved mat Diamond hexagon triangle base side up square circleCopy these to a piece of paper as they'll come in handy in a bit
When you'redone climb down the stairs go past the bubble and turn to the right
Proceedalong the beach until you find two large boulders with dried green seaweed onthem
There's a gap between them you can squeeze through
Do so On the other side you'll find a lot of bones and a very strange looking birdnear a boulder with the special Bahro action symbol for this Age
Copy it tothe slate
This one is made of three horizontal wavy lines
It is used tosummon gale winds which we will be doing in just a bit
Exit this site viathe path between the boulders on the other side and you'll see a lagoon witha strange metallic gate Wade into the lagoon and enter the gate
Proceed halfway through the canal andturn to the left
There's a broken section of wall that will allow you toclimb to a grassy courtyard
Proceed forward and to the right to find awindmill structure This windmill will allow you to change the position of a cage inside the canalyou just went through allowing you to gain access to the first pedestal forthis Age and afterwards access to the rest of the Age
But in order tooperate the windmill you'll need wind
That's where the Bahro come in Before you summon the wind though go to the back of the windmill climb upinto the control area and familiarize yourself with the controls
You'll seethree levers and two buttons the big lever on the left releases the windmill brake allowing it to spin the small lever on the left controls the vertical movement of the cage the left button opens a gate you'll need to get through the right button is out of order the right lever makes the cage turnNow you know what does what climb down from the controls draw the windsymbol and drop the slate
Wait for the Bahro to summon the wind pick theslate climb into the controls again and do the following pull big left lever once pull left lever once press left button once pull right lever three timesWhen this is done make your way to the canal enter the larger open cage andmake your way to the small cage with the pedestal on it
Climb on and look atthe pedestal
Copy the symbol to the slate two square triangles standingapart or an equal sided triangle split in half and drop it by the pedestal Move away and let the Bahro link in and put the slate on the pedestal
Whenthis is done pick it up return to the windmill and once more summon thewind
At the controls do the following pull big left lever once pull right lever three timesThis will turn the opening on the cage with the pedestal towards the now opencanal and let you proceed on your journey
Now go back to the start bubblevia canal then courtyard with the wind symbol and the beach
Once there enter the bubble and link to the first pedestal using the lit symbol on therim below the space for the slate
When you appear near the pedestal climbdown into the water and proceed along this new canal to the flooded Arena On entering the Arena you'll see a large pillar atop a ramp with the secondpedestal for the Age on top of it
Climb up the ramp and look on the wallbehind the pillar
You'll find four grey buttons with some red crystals abovethem in pairs and with lids a central golden button and a weighing stationto the left with the pillar on your back
Each of the four grey buttons hasa symbol on it with a different number of circles
From right to left thenumber of circles increases from one to four This is a weight puzzle
What you have to do here is to figure out how muchyou weigh with the slate and how much the pillar weighs
Why
Because you needto set the counter weights the grey buttons in such a way that when you linkto the second pedestal the pillar will hold your weight and allow you toaccess the footbridge directly above your head So let us start
Begin by weighing yourself at the weighing station to theleft
Step onto the pressure plate and you'll see that you weigh two redcrystals on the three circle line plus one crystal on the one circle line which means you weigh x x red crystals Now to get at the pedestal push each of the grey buttons so that the redcrystals above them are covered
When you're done press the central goldenbutton and the pillar will lower Copy the symbol on the pedestal to the slate it looks like a torso and a headabove it or a circle above a rectangle without the base
Drop the slate andlet the Bahro do his work
Once the slate is on the pedestal pick it up andlet's find out how much the pillar weighs when it is set to be on level withthe footbridge
If you fiddle with the grey buttons and the golden buttonyou'll find out that the pillar weighs x x x redcrystals Note Rasmus sent me a note saying that you must add for your own weight ifyou are carrying the slate or subtract if not
Otherwise you'll be tooheavy and the pillar will sink to the bottom
This note is more of asuggestion for those of you that are just skimming the walkthrough
If you'refollowing it you don't have to worry about it as I have calculated thecorrect weight with the slate in mind This means that if you want the pillar to take your weight and allow youaccess to the footbridge the counterweight must be set to redcrystals or x x x
If all the grey buttons have theirred crystals covered press grey four circles button twice grey three circles button twice grey two circles button onceAfter this press the golden button to set the counterweight
Let the pillarrise and go down the ramp into the water
Exit to the left and follow thecanal to the end
At the end continue forward and drop into the courtyardwhere you found the wind symbol
From there make your way to the link bubbleat the start and use the lit symbol for the second pedestal to link there When you appear on the pillar it will begin to lower
When it stops turnaround and walk onto the footbridge
Go to the left until the end of the path At the end turn to the left and press the red button there to open a metalgate in the Arena
After that return to the footbridge and go right to meetwith Esher and listen to another speech
He'll talk about the harvest of thegems i e
the hearts of the beasts and revel in it
Quite the sadist ourlittle Esher
Starting to mix qualities from Sirrus and Achenar aren't you When he links away approach the door to your left
Remember the piece ofpaper with the geometric shapes you saw through the window at the start of theAge
This lock has them all with the exception of the triangle with the baseside up
Since you can't turn the lock upside down this means the paper yousaw was upside down which in turn means the order you should press thebuttons on the lock will be reversed on the paper
So what you need to do ispress the buttons in this order Circle square triangle base side down hexagon diamondAs soon as you do the door opens
Enter the trade house and take a lookaround
You can see a lot of Bahro hearts lying on various surfaces the codefor the door on the table in front of you and several art pieces on the walls Go to the room on the right
Go past the painting depicting the slaying of abeast and behind a chair you'll find on top of a table another piece ofpaper with a colour sequence on it
This one shows red blotch red blotch green blotch and blue blotch
Make a note of it for future reference When you're through with exploring the trade house head outside and climbdown into the water via the broken wall section on the stands
Enter the gateyou've opened by pressing the red button on the other side
This is sort of amaze like structure
Proceed forward and turn left at the end
Continueforward from there to the first intersection and turn right there
Forwardagain until you reach a big metal circle on the floor This is another elevator puzzle
Only this time you'll need the help of theBahro to get you up to the second floor
Go past the elevator and look at thecounterweight on the left
At the end of this corridor there's a pressureplate
The elevator will rise if there's some one standing on the plate
Sinceyou can't stand on the plate and take the elevator up a Bahro will have tohelp you Draw the symbol found on Yeesha's seventh journal the one with a circle topleft and a curved Bahro figure turned to the right on the slate and drop iton the plate
This will ensure you have enough time to set the counterweightand get to the elevator as the Bahro will link in and sing a bit apparently Turn around walk to the counterweight and set it as high as it will go
Walkto the elevator and wait for the Bahro to link in
When he does the elevatorwill take you up Note I've had a lot of emails from people saying that they couldn't get pastthis puzzle by using the snake symbol
Instead they used the symbol found inYeesha's seventh journal the one described above
That's why I opted forpresenting that as the correct solution and leaving the one that worked andstill works for me as a side note If you draw the snake symbol the one from Noloben on the slate and drop iton the plate it might work for you as it did for me
But if after you triedit it doesn't work then use the symbol in Yeesha's Diary
This will save youa lot of headaches On the upper floor take a look around
There are four corridors each with acoloured jewel visible from here
Remember the paper with the colour blotchesform the trade house
This is where you'll use it
Find the red corridor thathasn't got the elevator controls like the one downstairs if you were facingthe pressure plate downstairs when the elevator came up it's the corridoryou're facing now
Proceed to the end of it and press the red button
At theintersection turn right where the other red button can be seen and go thatway
Press the red button
Turn right to the green button and go that way Press the green button and turn left to the blue button on the wall
Go to itand press the blue button
Wall opens to the outside allowing you to exitthrough it On exiting the maze you'll find the third pedestal
This one has a symbolthat looks like a Y but then the upper lines fork into two Y themselves
Copyit to a piece of paper and use the pedestal to link back to the start youneed to recover the slate
Once at the bubble pick the slate exit thebubble draw the third pedestal symbol drop the slate and let the Bahro linkaway with it
Enter the bubble again and use the lit third symbol to link tothe third pedestal
Pick the slate once you get there Turn to the left and go to the shore
You'll find a shipwreck there along withEsher who delivers yet another speech
He's impressed with you and talksabout the way of the Kresh the maze you just navigated and reveals a bit ofxenophobia towards the outsiders who tried to rebuild D'ni DRC hard hatanyone
When he finishes turn right and go forward between a large boulderwith seaweed on your left and a pond with a boulder on your right
When youarrive at another pond turn left and go towards the structure you can see inthe distance This is another weight puzzle
The objective here it to balance the beam infront of you so that two openings that are currently blocked allow you accessto a lookout point if you want go behind the boulder to the right of thestones and cables and you'll see a door attached to the beam blocking anentrance
I solved this puzzle by trial and error messing around with therocks and cables until the beam looked balanced to me There are seven rocks that act like weights and seven suspended cables thatset the rocks up or down
Numbering the rocks through left to right here's how you need to set them d u d d u u uwhere d means down or on the ground and u means up or suspended
Whenthey're set behind the boulder to the right of the stones and cables circling to the left and enter the opening
Follow the tunnel all the way upto the lookout point
Once up there go to the window and you'll see a far offisland
It's the Keep
On the flag to your left outside of the window there'sa symbol that you can't quite see
Time to summon the wind again Use the wind symbol drop the slate and let the Bahro do his thing
Approachthe window pick the slate and copy the symbol on the flag to the slate
Thisone is hard to describe
It looks like half of a fish with its tail to theright and the head to the left like the other half is under the water
Whenyou have it on the slate drop it and let the Bahro link away with it to theKeep Make your way down and to the third pedestal
Use it to link to the startbubble and from there use the Keep symbol on the rim to link to the far offisland
You'll be ejected from the bubble and Esher will deliver his finalspeech
The speech is about treasures and the Tablet
He'll make his goodbyes and tell you about the choice you'll have to make
He'll also take theopportunity to slander Yeesha a bit more and tell you that he has unlocked thebook in K'veer allowing you to link to Myst and bring the Tablet to him When the speech ends take a moment to save the game by taking a picture thisis in case you want to see the alternate endings
After the save is done enter the bubble and touch the slate
The final clamp is released and you'reautomatically linked to K'veer
K'veer revisited Pick the Tablet by clicking on it and walk out of the bubble
If you approachYeesha with it she'll open her arms to receive the slate
Before you give itto her think about all that you've read seen and listened throughout thegame You know that whoever holds the Tablet commands the Bahro
You also know thatthe poor Bahro have been slaves for a long time
Don't you think it's timethey took command of their own destiny
Yeesha told you not to give the Tabletto her as she wouldn't be able to hold it
Esher craves the power the Tabletholds and if you've been listening to him you know that is not the kind ofperson you should give the Tablet too
So what to do
There's a third option You can drop the Tablet and let the Bahro take it
That way the Tablet willbe theirs and their slavery will come to an end Drop the Tablet and step away from it
The Bahro will link in and take it Then he'll take you
You'll see Yeesha fall on her knees and deliver a mostemotion filled speech
Three Bahro will link in After a bit you'll be linked to Releeshan and witness the reunion of Yeeshawith her very old father Atrus
Listen to their reunion and witness all thatgoes on
Atrus talks about hope a new beginning and a new D'ni
A very happynote on which to end the game and the Myst journey Another character links in and you'll see Esher getting his just dessert He'll cuss up a storm at you Yeesha and everyone
Yeesha delivers him to theBahro to do as they wish with himYeesha will then deliver her final speech also on a note of hope
A trulyinspiring speech
Watch her walk away with her father the Bahro spread hiswings and take flight and enjoy the view of Releeshan absolutely stunning andbeautiful
Only wish there were more Myst titles so that we could explore it Roll on credits with Releeshan as a backdrop
After that the game ends
Final Considerations Alternate endingsThere are three alternate endings to the game First alternate ending give the Tablet to Yeesha Approach Yeesha and give her the Tablet
She won't be able to hold it and itwill fall between her hands
She will then look crestfallen and dejected andwalk way without saying a word to you
After a bit she'll link out If you then leave this chamber via the exit under the stair to your left you'll be able to reach the room in which the game began by following thecorridor and the stairs up
Once there use the Myst book to link to Myst Age Make your way to the Library
The Age is in disrepair and decaying all aroundyou
At the Library you'll meet Esher and he'll say how you made the wrongchoice after all he helped you with and that you are now trapped here
He'lllink out and leave you in Myst where there is nothing to do Second alternate ending give the Tablet to Esher Go past Yeesha and leave this chamber via the exit under the stair to yourleft
Continue up the stairs to the room where the game started
Use the Mystbook to link to Myst Age
Make your way to the Library
As with the otherending the Age is in disrepair and decaying all around you Enter the Library and place the Tablet in the metal support you find there Esher will link in and prove how evil and mad he is
He'll insult you showhis full arrogance and deliver a very long speech about what he'll do with thepower the Tablet gives him
He'll even cackle a few times and throw in acouple of giggles
As you can see he's clearly a few cards short of a fulldeck
When the speech ends you'll find that you are trapped Myst island isyour End forever Third alternate ending leave the Tablet aloneExit the keep without picking the Tablet and make your way to the room wherethe game started via the exit under the stairway to the left
Once you'rethere use the Myst book to link to Myst Age and make your way to the Library Esher will be there waiting for you and once more throw a tantrum because youdidn't choose to give the Tablet to him
Afterwards he'll leave and you'll betrapped in Myst forever Kudos to David Ogden Stiers for yet another brilliant performance
Well done Kudos also to Regin Altay for a most wonderful Yeesha to Rand Miller for awell done Atrus I can't imagine any other person playing him and to all theCyan Worlds team for the creation of a wonderful Universe and an amazingJourney
Bravo That's it

Mysterious Journey ndash Schizm Bridge building by Mordack Over the years Adventure Gamers have met their share of challenges but in many eyes what comes up as the greatest challenge is the infamous bridge puzzle in Mysterious Journey Schizm
The following is NOT a step by step guide to completing this puzzle but more or less a guide to understanding it Maybe with a little understanding your bridge won rsquo t fall
A complete step by step guide to wining this puzzle can rsquo t be given because of its randomness but the first five moves the player should try and make can be
We will concentrate on thesecond bridgeas this seems to be the more difficult of the two
When you start the puzzle the computer makes the first move
There is no rhythm or reason for its selection but it will not affect the player rsquo s strategy
More often than not the computer tries to make a straight connection from the top to bottom
It does this when it does NOT see a challenge from the player
In other words if the computer doesn rsquo t see the player rsquo s strategy it will continue with its own
Below is a screen capture of the first moves from the player and the first six moves from the computer marked accordingly in yellow
These are the first moves that the player should always attempt to make
At this point a couple of things can be said
The player rsquo s move is to prevent the computer from winning and it rsquo s also the first indication of the player rsquo s path
This explains the computers moves and
It rsquo s an attempt to block
If during your game the computer makes its sections that are not in a line as seen above then make those four corners selections first and your fifth move can be in the same row that has the most blocked by the computer
Below is the player and computers next moves
The computer now knows a path is being formed by the player and thus tries to block the direction of the path with move
At this point the player only has one move left The computer sees no threat currently by the bridges in the four corners not yet anyway
Next two player computer moves below
The player is well in control of the game and by now the computer ldquo see rsquo s rdquo the threat of the corners but it rsquo s too late
The screen shot above really shows the advantage of getting those corners
The player has three paths of choice on each side circled above on the left only to make the final connections
The computer attempts to block but can rsquo t possible block all the paths
If earlier in the game the computer blocked off any of the circled paths the player should not react to this but consider it a free move
Why
There are still two paths that can be won on and until the computer only leaves the player one path don rsquo t complete the bridge to that side
One strategy is to let the computer eliminate the player rsquo s multi path
This allows the player to concentrate on building the bridge elsewhere
The player just has to keep in mind when the proper time is to complete either side of the bridge
Below shows the players final move to win
In summary the keys to winning are getting as many moves made before the computer senses a players strategy i e
get those corners
Next leave those multi paths open and let the computer take them away
Finally play a couple of games following this strategy not to win or lose but to get a sense of understanding
Therefore you will be better at making choices for those moves by the computer that are random
Have fun

Space Station Traitor's Fate Sen Geder is awakened from cryogenic sleep by a hologram of his supposedly old friend Tensa
Tensa stated that Sen is responsible for the destruction of the planet Sarpendon below the space station two hundred fourteen years ago
Only a single valley remains at the planet
The space station will fall to the planet in days and he is imprisoned here
It is the first part of his punishment
All non essential machinery have been destroyed
Before the second part of his punishment can be stated the hologram is destroyed by a laser beam from the outside corridor
Sen does not have any memory of his past
Repairing Talen First time Go to the door and exit the room
Go forward to the large metal object a Companion that is in the corridor
The Companion asks for restore help
Go forward until the end of the corridor pass destroyed large spider like machines attached to the wall and a blocked side passage until you reach the metal door
On the left of the corridor is another broken companion lying on its side
See a use cursor when placed on the companion click and automatically a card appears in inventory
Go back to the first Companion
Face the front of the companion and use the card on it
The companion says that the upper promenade is now open and it wants more prion generator Second time Go back to the corridor and turn left on the now accessible mesh bridge
Look left when standing on the bridge and see another companion and a stand at the far ramps
Go to the end and turn left
The right path is blocked by an erratic laser beam
Go forward and left across the ramp
Take the open passage seen at the right
The passage has walkways on both sides that ends on top of a ramp
Rotating Corridorpuzzle Ahead are eight tumbler ramps that should be reset to form a corridor
In front is a stand that has buttons
Each button rotates one to three tumbler ramps
Study which button rotates what ramp
Then press the buttons to get all the gold knobs on top and make a corridor at the base
Save game here
One possible solution is Press from left to right Buttons
Another solution is
If mistake is done go back to the saved game
Go forward on the corridor
Go to the stand on the right ramp and raise the right bar to turn off the power to the broken laser beam blocking the passage at the middle level
Go to the other side face the companion and click use
A cutscene occurs
Access to shuttle bay Go to the end of the corridor and see a stand to the right of the companion that is lying on its side
Opening shuttle bay door The stand with arrows is the control that moves the bars on the other side of the shuttle door on the left
As Talen stated Study the relationship of the parts with its design
To find out what happens when you change any arrow position go to the mesh bridge forward and now that the beam is off turn right to a ramp that goes up
Go forward and up the ramp
Look through the window and note of the position of the bars above the shuttle door on the right
This is a random puzzle
The object of the puzzle is to move the bars so that the space will be centered on the center bolt
Take note where the position of the space is on the different bars from top to bottom and how many position movements are needed to center the space the bars
This is the other side of the door so note that the position will be reversed on the other side where the control stand is located
Go back to the stand and move one arrow and see how it affects the bar on the other side The looking at the bars and changing the arrows on the control panel need to be done several times
Good luck
Shuttle Bay Enter the open access door and go forward
A warp cursor brings you to the shuttle bay
Go forward and see a force field blocking entry to the shuttle
Go back to the side passage
Enter the elevator carriage on the right by the entryway
Walk the bridge and look down
See roomful of pods and a single lamp on the right side close to an eyelike lens on the wall
Go down to the main level
Go forward to the third row of pods and turn right
Look at the base of the lamp
Press the button and power starts humming
Laser flow puzzle The object of the puzzle is to make a series of unbroken laser beams to the eyelike lens on the wall
Each laser pod has sides with openings and sealed walls
The openings have either a pipe like or a rounded hole
The laser should come out of the protruding pipe end and received by a rounded hole
Look at the pod behind the lamp
There should be energy going out of it when the button was pressed
Go close to the pod behind the lamp and use turn it so that energy goes out though the outlets to the next pods
The outlets should be away from the lamp one to the left and one to the back with the lamp on the right
Do not position a laser to the pod on the wall or to the one facing the lamp
Proceed from here
Good luck

Enter and see the elevator on the right

Go to lamp
Look down and press button to start laser flow

Turn pod behind the lamp now called start pod xs
White circles Follow the black arrows and the white circles pods while turning the pods as noted with black numbers on the graph Stop at the pod left of the one in front of the eye
Red white circles Go back to the pod right of the start pod
Turn the pod right of the start pod xs
Blue circles Go to pod left of pod below the start pod and follow the blue arrows while turning the pods as noted with blue numbers

Turn the pod in front of the eye xs move away and see a cutscene
Watch the shuttle bay door open and hear Talen call Sen
There are tribes Transai and Ansala
The Transais believe in the old technology and believe science is the only answer for survival while the Ansalas believe in love of nature and natural methods
Talen gives Sen flight skills update and chameleon tech so that Sen can be disguised as a nomad from badlands
Watch the shuttle flies and crash lands on the planet
The Valley Companion Beach Click use on the Danoosha a Companion at the beach
See the remains of the shuttle and an inoperative companion on the left path
Go up to the path on either side of the mountain wall
Neutral Zone See two bridges that need to be reset to cross
One is tech and the other natural
Transai side Go down the left path and see a stand with a view of columns of bridge segments
Tech Bridge The object of the puzzle is to raise the bridge even to the cable that is stretched out on the gap
The stand has finger like knobs on top
The knobs move the stand to face each of the bridge segment columns
The red button shoots red energy that resets the puzzle
The blue button shoots out blue energy that raises the columns
Throw blue energy to any column s to see how much column height is raised by each balls
Note that the height increases in relation to the sequence of the blue energy thrown i e
first blue energy thrown raises the column the least and the last energy raises the column highest
Let us say first blue energy thrown raises it one step the second thrown steps third steps etc
Reset the columns by pressing the red button
Then check each column to see how many steps are needed for it to reach the level of the cable
If it goes over the cable do columns until you reach the correct level and note the steps needed to reach that point
By process of elimination I found that L R Column needs steps column needs steps column needs steps and column needs steps
Then find out one of the possible sequence of energy thrown to all column to raise them to even height level to the cable that spans the gap
When correctly done the close up view of the stand pulls back automatically
One possible solution is Labeling the columns from left to right as
Shoot blue energy to columns
Another solution is
Cross the Tech bridge and meet some Transais
Jimi a newly appointed team leader talks to Sen as Jano an engineer who has been missing for years
They will secure the shuttle and would meet you at Touchstone
When they leave try to enter the force field but the sentry portal recognizes your chameleon enhancement and will not let you through
Go back across the tech bridge
Ansala side Go down the steps under the giant leaf
See a plant stand that has buttons on top and colored buttons at the bottom
On the water are plants
Natural bridge The object of the puzzle is to raise the plants in the water so that the segments will end up with leaves to create a continuous path to the other side
The buttons on top of the control plant target the plants in the water
The red button resets an individual plant in the water
The blue button makes three segments the yellow two and the green one segment
This puzzle is played against the computer
The computer randomly adds a certain number of segments to what you add
The plant on the left needs segments the middle needs segments and the right plant needs segments to get to full height
These are found out by shooting randomly to to the top
One of the ways to trap the computer is to leave segments for the computer that are divisible by ex
or
Your color shot on the plant always ends in a segment with leaves
The computer immediately adds its segment that doesn't end in leaves
Since the computer segments are random Left plant Shoot green onleft plant to have one leafed segment leaving for the computer
The computer will then add non leafed segment s
Count the segments on the plant
Then add enough segment s by shootingblue button for three segments the yellow two and the green one segment to leave a number divisible by
The last addition should complete the height of that plant
Adjust the number to get the plant on the left to segments the middle to segments and the right plant to segments
ex
You shot green to make one segment the computer adds one non leafed segment
The plant is completed with segments
So minus minus segments to go
Shoot blue to add segments to make the plant have segments for completion
The computer might shoot one non leaf segment after you to make segments on the plant and needs more for completion
Shoot blue to make segments and the plant is completed with a leafed segment at the top
Shoot green onmiddle plant to have one segment leaving for the computer
Follow as above
Good luck
Shootyellow on right plant to have two segment leaving for the computer
Follow as above
Good luck
Cross the natural leaf bridge and meet Saku

The sentry portal's force field is removed
Transai bridge puzzle The bridge are all misaligned and some have an activated force field
The object of the puzzle is to align the bridge and deactivate the force fields
Turn around and go to the stand close to the cliff edge
This is a random puzzle
Look at the stand
The top buttons rotates segments of the bridges and bottom buttons deactivates the force field
Note which buttons turn which segment of the bridge
Start by aligning the bridge segment that is controlled by only one button let's call it segment A
Do not touch that button again
Then find which button also moves the companion segment B of segment A
Move that button until segment B is aligned
Find the button that moves the companion of B etc Continue from here
Good luck
Halcyon Woods Cross the bridge and exit to a woody area

Only one place second to the right button will have any active areas to explore
Transai Skyport Walk the ramp and enter through the door
See a fog covered platform on the left and a ramp on the right
Skyport maze Go down the ramp and look up
Map the maze and note the position of the step before and after a turn based on the lamp on each side
Go up stand on the start area andSAVE GAME This will let you restart the maze that you already mapped
The puzzle randomizes after a fall through the fog
The lamp on each side is at the center point of each slab
Hints I used my mouse for control
I made a chart with the turn needed L or R how many slabs to walk on and very important the lamp position that I will face when I do the turn
Remember that one click of the mouse or W key moves to one slab it takes clicks to move to middle of second slab
Walk to the end of the segment while cursor iscenteredon the lamp you need to go to
Then check right or left to see if you are centered on the side lamps an d that you are where you need to
Using the chart and the constant check of the position of the lamp helped a lot
Falling off and walking the maze changes the maze pattern to an easier one
Map the easier maze for you
Patience and Good luck

Telescope Every ramp has a telescope while one ramp has two
Each telescope is focused on a security gate on the ramp that circles the tower
Use a telescope and see that the filters are placed on either side of the telescope
Click on one or both filters and they will be placed over the lens
The top button removes the filter while the lower button rotates the gate seen through the telescope
Determine the correct red gate and rotate the gate so that the correct gate is farthest from the tower or situated at the outward part of the perimeter
To know which gate is correct place both filters over the telescope lens
The colors seen is the reverse of the correct one so a blue gate is really the red gate and vice versa
Rotate all blue colored gate to the outer side while both filters is over the telescope lens
Do this on all the telescopes
Solution by Judith Thanks Judith Standing in front of the ramp with the two telescopes go to the first telescope on the left the telescopes will be done last
Looking in this telescope put the blue filter on the left by green rock
Continue left
the second telescope put blue on left
Continue left
Third telescope put blue on left
Fourth telescope blue on left by brown amp green rocks
Fifth telescope blue on left by brown amp green with white rocks
Sixth telescope blue on left by green amp red purple amp white rock
Seventh telescope blue on left by same colored rocks
Ramp with telescopes the one on the left put blue on right by rocks
the right telescope put blue on the left by rocks
When done enter the tower and it will automatically go to the fifth floor
Exit to a ramp that will lead to the building seen through the telescope
The left inner side of the gates are blocked
Since you arranged the correct 'red' gate to the right outer side walk the ramp and enter the building
If all the above was done correctly and the portal at the end of the ramp still doesn't open delete all the saved games done while doing the telescope puzzle
Go back to a saved game prior to reaching the th floor of the tower
Proceed with the puzzle without saving and hopefully you can enter the portal at the end of the ramp

Secret of Sarpedon Sen meets with the Ansala Oracle
Arko Carluen and Loreann arrive and tell Sen the true history of Sarpedon
Oracles are the central coordinating units for colonization of the planet
Companions are planetary engines for processing nitrogen producing greenhouse gases and changing the soil
The watch crew of the colony ship that was to colonize this planet formed factions based on their ideas about terraforming the planet the beginning of the Ansala and Transai tribe
The Ansalas took one Oracle out of the network and took it to the valley
A fight ensued between the two factions that resulted in the destruction of the colony ship Lyra
The Oracles who are in communications with each other decided to mindwipe the population and impose a memory of history of global war
Sen needs the station maps and access codes for the station
Sen and Chemay are Ansala sleepers double agents
Sen needs to restore the Oracle companion terraforming network at the Overide chamber on the station
There is a reconnection override left by the Ansalas in case they need to use it again
Carluen and Loreann cannot help Sen because the Oracles they tend need to be manually adjusted
Arko will open and close the protection field overhead manually at the precise moment of reactivation of the network
The Ansala Oracle prepared a ship for Sen to get to the station
She gives an ancient number of power
Sen has little over hours before the space station crashes down
Space Station Finding Chemay Go forward and note the symbols on the crate sitting on the left side facing the right corridor
Go to each door at the end of the hallways
Each door has a set of colored glyphs
They are door locks
Above the colored glyphs are the labels for those doors of which are found on the crate
Pick up thediskon top of a box at the corridor facing the crate with symbols
Go back to the intersection and see a big circular disk on the wall
Use the disk that was picked up on the metal decoder
Decoding the crate symbols The decoder disk has inner circles and radial sections with symbols similar to the crate
Using the crate symbols as a formula label of door the symbols to unlock the door
To convert the symbols in the formula to the colored glyphs on each door Select the first symbol to be converted and then rotate the first circle until the space shows a colored glyph under the first symbol on the outer perimeter of the disk
Select the second symbol to be converted and then rotate the second circle until the space shows a colored glyph under the second symbol on the outer perimeter of the disk
Do the same for the third and fourth symbols
The colored glyphs are the code to enter for that particular door
Top set of symbols on crate for first door
Bottom set of symbols on crate for second door
First door Go to door across the crate with symbols
Press white pointed star pink pointed star pink knobbed star and green pointed star
Door opens and then check the room
Second door Go to the door right of the white metal disk
Press pink knobbed star white pointed star green pointed star and pink knobbed star
Door opens go forward and see a crate with another set of symbols
Go to the right corridor and left at the next corridor
Towers Go through the door and come out on a ramp on top of towers
At the center is a layered taller tower
The tower roofs have numbers similar to the one that is on the airship control
Note the drawings of the numbers and we will decode it later
Look around and note that one of the windows on the wall is open
Go back and go through the corridor
Take the corridor across the crate with the new symbols
Enter the room at the end and see the window seen from the tower top
Note that the buttons overhead the window is similar to the ancient symbol seen during gameplay
Exit and go back to the metal decoder
Decode the tower numbers Across the metal decoder is a panel that has the base numbers
The bottom row shows the symbols seen on the crate and doors
Some numbers are missing
The top left is and is read across the row to at top right
The panel is a calculator with the mathematical function icons at the bottom
Select any a number press the bottom left icon press another number and you will get a sum
Compare the markings on the tower roof on the symbols on this calculator
The numbers on top of the towers are and
Decode the new crate symbols Note that the code for the unopened door symbol is equals to the symbol above the other doors with a mathematical function symbol addition in between
Since the metal decoder has radial segments and we have been using base here count the top of the metal decoder as and going clockwise to end at
As seen from decoding the door lock puzzle first door has the symbols at segments for the first circle for the second circle for the third circle and on the last circle
Check the graphic above
The second door has symbols at segments for the first circle for the second circle for the third circle and on the last circle
Check the graphic above
The crate formula will then be third door
The math function is seen at the calculator panel across the decoder wheel
So add the numbers first symbol second symbol third symbol and the fourth symbol is
Go to the metal decoder and turn the wheels to for the first circle for the second circle for the third circle and for the fourth inner circle
Third door Go to the third door and press yellow knobbed star pink pointed star pink pointed star and yellow dumbbell
End Game Sen is reunited with Chemay
Chemay will contact Arco and will work to get Talen fixed
Chemay gives Sen apriongenerator
Sen needs to find the reconnection override
Go forward and take the left corridor to the room with the window opened to the tower
Insert the prion generator on the slot at the right edge of the window frame
End Puzzle The buttons above the window is the same as that of the ancient symbols
The ancient number of powers given to Sen are and
The object of the puzzle is to make the ancient numbers on the towers
This is done by joining numbered towers using laser beams
The buttons are positions that shoot different combinations of laser beams to the towers
The middle large button turns on and toggles off the lasers
Check the laser combinations by pressing the different buttons individually then press the middle large button and note which towers are hit by the lasers
The tower numbers using base from left to right looking out from the window is and
Converting them to base make the towers from left to right and
To make the numbers of power point the laser beams on towers and by pressing button and then press the middle button
point the laser beams on towers and by pressing button and then press the middle button

Mysterious Journey Station Laser Pods and Transai Fog Maze Hints by Soren Andersen Station Laser Pod Array The laser pod array puzzle that you need to solve to gain access to the satellite shuttle is an intriguing one
Upon entering the large room containing this x array of pods you will be next to an elevator that you can take up to a catwalk where you can survey the pod layout
Move out on the catwalk and look to the right to see in the wall a dark oval lens and nearby a light on a curving pole
What you must do is initiate a laser beam and direct it from pod to pod so that it strikes the lens and opens a gate to the shuttle
Fig
shows the pod array as it is when you first enter the room and without reading further here you may at this time use it to develop the puzzle solution
Otherwise Take the elevator back down and go to the light on the pole
On the way examine the pods and you will find that When you get close to a pod it may be continuously rotated clockwise in increments of a quarter turn
The four sides of the pods are either blank have a hexagonal depression or a pipe protruding a short distance
This pipe under proper conditions is an emitter for a laser beam and the depressions contain receptors for a beam
All pods have or emitters and or receptors
Inside each pod is a transponder or mirror or prism such that when all receptors have laser beams impinging on them a beam is produced from all emitters
At the base of the light pole is a switch that turns on a laser in the master pod immediately behind the pole
It is clear that beams must illuminate the rotated pod next to the lens so working from this pod or from the master mdash or both mdash rotate pods to achieve this
You may check progress by observation from the catwalk
Fig
is a spoiler that gives the solution
Transai Skyport Random Path Getting through the fog covered Transai Skyport is not as difficult as it first appears
The hardest part is correctly mapping the randomly generated tile pathway that is seen looking up from the lower level this is facilitated if you note that the tiles alternate in appearance between a fine mesh and a marble finish
Fig
may be used as an aid in making the map and then traversing it
Save your game after you have made the map because if you fall off the path in the fog a new tile pathway is generated try it and see and you will want to be able to get back to the one that you have mapped
The key to getting through the fog is to listen for the sound that is heard as you pass from one tile to the next including that from the entrance mesh to the first tile
Place the cursor on the light pole at the far end of the rank or file that you are using then carefully note the number of tiny steps that you take from a tile edge it takes or to get to the tile center
You may wish to use the keyboard W key for this instead of the mouse and you can use the S key to move backward The fog generators close down after you get past them at the exit but you will have pass back through the Skyport a couple times later in the game the quick way to do this is to deliberately walk off the tile path and you can then go right to the lower level access ramp

Scarf the poor bugger's few coins and vamoose
Go to the phone lift the receiver open the phone book and put a coin in the slot
You are expecting Dr Turner but some woman answers instead
A secretary maybe
She's rather abrupt with you and the good Doctor won't be back for several weeks
Return to the laboratory and talk with Chris
He informs you that the woman is Melanie Dr Turner's daughter
Go back to the phone booth call her again and in the course of the conversation she agrees to see you in the Museum
Go meet with her and tell her everything you can
When the conversation ends you are now playing as Melanie
As MelanieExamine everywhere in the lab
Find the Microtome scraper and place the bone on it to create a thin section
Put the shaving into the microscope and focus by clicking the knob forward several times
When it becomes clear you can see a fleck of gold
Look at the table with weapons
The sickle at the bottom stands out from the rest of the implements
Use the large bone on it to discover that the nicks match the shape of the sickle
Read the articles about historic Britain and past Druid activities
Tell Halligan what you have learned
Tell him about Arthur Blake As Brent HalliganRestored to your former scintillating self you suppress the urge for a pizza and head for Blake's house Arthur BlakeSpeak with Mr Blake about everything you can
You will learn about Druids the Amulet of transformation
More than you ever wanted to know really
Head to Portsmouth and Ride the ferry to France CarmorsTry speaking with the Ferry boat captain
He doesn't seem to have much to say
Let's see if the fisherman will be more cooperative
Well he is sort of if we keep the volume down that is
Talk with him about everything
Your purpose here is to learn the captain's full name which will encourage him to be more sociable
If the fisherman doesn't tell you the captain's name right off keep nagging him until he does
Addressing the Captain by his proper title does the trick
He becomes a regular Chatty Cathy
Listen to his stories and encourage talk of Druids
Find out that salt is able to bring down their buildings
Look down at the water line of the boat and discover some salt sticking there
It probably would be a good idea to have some salt just in case This would be a nice time to save your game
Talk to the fisherman again and learn that they are old drinking pals but the captain's cat can be a nuisance
Now you see a plan starting to come together
If you can get the cat to help you the fisherman's equipment might come in handy
He is unwilling to either loan or sell it To catch the cat After you talk with the fisherman about the Captain and you learn that the Captain's cat is a nuisance you will see the cat each time you back away from a conversation with Pierre
To bag the cat you must stay out of the way because the cat is shy
Stand next to the crate labeled Carmors wait until you see the cat walk from left to right and stop behind the two other crates
Wait some more but have thegreen clothready the one you took from your office
When the cat moves again and stops for a moment use the green cloth on the cat
Go back to the fisherman's area and let the cat go
She knocks the bait into the water and the fisherman grudgingly leaves to buy more bait
He trusts you to watch his precious rod and reel
He never met that beggar apparently
So if you take the rod and take the bucket they can be combined to create a salt scraper
Go to the boat and fetch a pail of salt At the Old Castle de Carmors On your map it's called Schloss Carmors in German
Make your way around the far left side and find the locked gate
You don't have the key but you can slip the lock with the file folder Chief gave you
Look at the headstones until you find one with a hollow spot on top
Put the salt there and grind it to a fine powder with the bone
Take the salt with you and go around to the Mausoleum
Add a pinch of salt and Whoosh
Down comes three thousand years of history
A charming little treasure chest is revealed
Oooh
Oooh
it contains the Amulet of Transformation
How could we be so lucky so early on in the game
Let's get on that boat and head home with the good news
Arthur Blake will be just thrilled
By the way who was that sneaky chap hiding behind a crypt
Could it be we're being watched On the Ferry BoatMyself I like a little fresh air during a channel crossing
Try stepping outside though and you decide to hide the amulet rather than take a chance of losing it topside
Open the flap on the bottom of the ventilation shaft and hide the amulet
Nobody would ever think to look there
Out to check on the seagulls
Uh Oh
Coming back we find somebody ransacked the place
And what's more they looked in the shaft
That's just what we're going to get the Shaft
Let's go face Mr Blake Arthur BlakeHe accepts the bad news graciously almost as if he expected as much
He goes on to explain Neo Druids and The Circle
That wasn't so painful
Time to face the boss This would be a nice time to save your game Scotland YardWell if Mr Blake was genteel the Chief certainly isn't
He heard how you clipped the beggar never admit to anything and thinks you're wasting the department's time fooling around with all this hocus pocus stuff
Well if we're going to make any headway at all we need more information
Go see Janet in the Records Room
That's to the left of the Coke machine
If you happened to ask the Chief for permission to access the data you were told in no uncertain terms that you should do your investigating the old fashioned way with your feet
Nuts to that idea
We need efficiency and we need it now
Janet won't let you into the system either because you need a signed form
Pick up a form and try to get the Chief to sign it
No Way
We'll have to blind side him somehow
Go to Records and get a clipboard a piece of carbon paper and a form to request stationery
While you are right there read the notice on the pin board from the Chief If we assemble these items correctly the chief should approve our request for stationery and unwittingly produce a signed data request at the same time
Great scheme but the carbon paper sticks out and he would notice
Got to trim it somehow
Let's see who might have a pair of scissors
Finding such a thing in your own office would be hopeless it's such a mess
Go there anyway just to check on things
Your answering machine is blinking
The top arrow plays a message you have six and the other two arrows cycle up and down through them
Think hard about message number five from the Chief
It just might be useful
Go talk to Lowry
The way to get him out of the office so you could borrow his scissors would be to phone him up and scare him out of the room
Talk to him everything but especially about dating Janet Insult him I'd like to know


Well I would have thought


Keep it up until you get the option to get help with the copier or use his phone
Ask to use the phone If the choice to use his phone does not appear go back to your office pick up the receiver No I'd rather use the speaker phone try todial a number and notice the missing dial tone
Now the conversation with Lowry will include a reference to the phone
Keep at him until he gives you his extension number Well I would have thought


Go to your office and use the speaker phone button to call ext

Play message and Lowry dashes out of his precious office leaving it all to you
Get the scissors snip off the excess carbon and go directly to the Chief
If Lowry's still in there getting chewed out go somewhere
Your office the lab Janet's it matters not
When you come back you can enter
Give the Chief the stationery form to sign
Make your way out and go to Janet
She still wants a request for data form signed by the Chief himself
Give her the ersatz form and ask for information on the Circle
She digs into the archives finds about Lord Sinclair a murder and other things
When she is finished ask for a printout
Take the printout from the printer and go into the hallway and make a copy
Go to the museum and put the copy into the letterbox in order that Ms Turner will know where we are
Sinclair MansionNow that's some ritzy cottage
Try the doorbell
No matter what we say to the butler there's no getting inside at least the normal way
Go around to the right side and examine the fence
Perhaps we can find a way through there
Trying the scissors the wire is too heavy
Go around the left side and notice some cut grass
It's dry
Talk to the gardener at length to learn about the grounds and their owner
Maybe we could distract the gardener and take his tools
Set fire to the dry grass with the matches you took from the Chief remember
and you will have access to the garden shears
Go back to the right side fence clip the hedge and cut the heavy wires
Ooops the shears broke
The scissors will take care of the light weight wire
Ooops the scissors broke
Don't touch the fence directly it's electrified
Use the gloves to widen the hole
Now it needs insulation so you can crawl through
Combine the scarf with a plastic bag to protect from electric shock Important Before you go through the hole be sure to pick up thepiece of wirethat fell to the ground Slide through and meet Jack who introduces you to Lord Sinclair
You are invited to dinner like it or not
You are locked in your room
How to get out
The door is locked the wardrobe is locked the window is locked
Examine the large painting over the bed
Ugghh
Left click on it and night falls
Left click on the paintint again and take it down
Use the frame to pry out the nail
Use the nail to remove the canvas
Notice the slit under the door
Notice the dark keyhole
Maybe we could retrieve the key by dropping it onto something thin and flat
The canvas won't fit through the slit
Take the nail and pry up a couple of tiles
Now the canvas fits
Use the nail to push the key out and pull it back under the door
You are free
Go downstairs and into the dining room
Examine the pictures on the wall especially the one close to the table which resembles the symbol on the Amulet of Transformation It's the Druid symbol for fire
Go out the back door and a long cutscene ensues where you observe a gruesome Druid ritual then join the Circle at dinner
You become one of them
Then Melanie Turner reads your note and decides to check up on you Melanie at the MansionThe butler never wavers
There's no use pursuing that route
Go around to the right and crawl through the hole Halligan made
Hide behind the first bush
The rocks go to your inventory automatically
Put them into your hand This is an ESSENTIAL time to save your game
Do it
There are two guards
One is watching the front of the house and the other walks back and forth along the side
When the side guard walks away throw a stone at the front
Wait until the side guard comes to a stop beside the front guard then dash behind the next bush
then into the open window
They might see you enter the window but will not follow
Examine things in the room bones skulls an altar with a bowl of blood an interesting device under the painting touch the device
a weird painting and a Pentagram which gives all the appearance of a puzzle
You can turn the outer ring which is filled with warriors
one of which is facing the opposite direction and one isstanding straight
Turn the outer wheel until the straight man is at the bottom and turn the star until it is inverted with the bead at the bottom
You will hear something unlock
It would be nice to have a click in the subtitles for people who can't hear the sound effects
Go to the weird picture and slide it to reveal a safe
The combination is deduced from the painting
The ten o'clock one o'clock and six o'clock positions appear to be important
Try clicking the rectangular button
Listen to the sound
Now turn the combination to
Press the button and notice the slight difference
That is the first digit
Then one click six click
The safe opens and you receive a parchment covered with runic writing and the Amulet of Transformation
Uh Oh
The door rattles
In comes Brent Halligan
He is just not himself
Shall we say he's been off his feed
A very long cutscene ensues ending with a conversation at Mr Blake's
Continue talking with him until he mentions the need for a book Celtic Orthographic Systems by Scott M Winfield
You will go to the Oxford Library to find it
At the Oxford University LibraryWalk right in and go see the Librarian
What a grumptious old bag she is
Talk with her all you want she won't budge
Examine the valuable book exhibits if you like and go into the left wing left if you are facing the Librarian that is and speak to the man at the computer
He is Professor Hastings
He won't relinquish his spot but if we could use the computer we might figure out how to look for the book
Let's find a way to get him out of his chair
Go across the lobby into the right wing and see the pile of books on the table
Roman Monetary Systems
Not the most exciting stuff perhaps but take one anyway
Now try to get outside with it
The magnetic sensor catches you and you get dressed down in no uncertain terms
Boy she makes the lady at GK 's Ludwig Museum seem almost charming
Go back to Professor Hastings and slip the book into his pocket
He is so involved he won't notice
Then go outside walk up to his BMW and find a way to set off the alarm
Use thewireyou saved from Sinclair's fence to pick the lock
Slip it into the crack above the window
The car alarm sounds and Hastings runs through the magnetic trap getting caught
Now you can use the computer to learn the book's location
It says C B
Go to the wing behind the Librarian and enter the stacks on the far right
If you are in the C stack click on shelf to climb the ladder and find the book
Whee
Down the ladder the easy way
Did you notice Blake called the book Celtic Orthographic Systems Halligan called it Celtic Literary Systems and the computer called it Old Celtic Alphabets
How can we get this book out
She won't let it be circulated
Aha
Back to those Roman coin books andborrow one of the dust covers
It fits well enough and that title can be borrowed
Check it out you've hit her field of interest
She turns as nicey nice as she was nasty before
Let's give it to Mr Blake Arthur BlakeTake the book to Arthur Blake and let him translate the parchment for you
Talk with him and Melanie who seems a bit over protective at the moment
Suddenly in the midst of the conversation a tremor begins frightening you into leaving
The house is struck by a shell or a bolt of magic or something and erupts in flames
Blake is lost
We have nothing left to do but head for twelve bridges and try to save the world



WORLDS Twelve BridgesHave some conversation but don't get too too personal
After all weareprofessionals
Go look at the Caution sign andtake the boardswith you
Head up the only available bridge the one that appears to be in the best repair
Use a board to create a temporary bridge
Use the other board to step forward
Keep cycling the boards until you get to the other side
Melanie will follow barely escaping the ultimate collapse
There's no going back now
Have a look at those scales
That mechanism should lift the door if we can find the correct weight
Do we have anything that might weight more than it looks
Something magical perhaps
Put the amulet in the tub and up it goes
You can't just walk in and leave the amulet behind however you need to prop up the door so you can take it with you
Use the remaining board to hold up the door
Crouching down you and Melanie go inside and look around
More Druid symbols on the floor notice the sequence
and another tub
Go back outside to the scale and remove the screw on the left side taking it and the heavy hook with you
Then go into the tower and pull the wooden board out from under the door allowing the tub and hourglass to rise
Look closely at the hourglass and remove the screw using the broken scissors
Put the hook into the square opening and enjoy the scene
Part Two One Thousand Years AgoThe Soldiers' CampYou arrive seemingly where you left off at the Gate of the Worlds
Upon looking outside however the bridges appear intact nearly new
Some soldiers approach
Ooops they are not so friendly
Melanie finds herself in a medieval kitchen
Look to the far right for a cookbook
Read the recipes
Go into the dining room and talk with the soldiers
They believe you are a Danish spy preparing for an invasion of England
No wonder they're unfriendly
Go back to the kitchen then return to the dining room
It's payday and the mood has greatly improved
They mentionone ouncepieces of silver
An ounce weight could be useful
Talk with them offering to make a love potion and compliment them on their equipment
Then as the soldier is more relaxed take a coinfrom the pouch hanging from the back of his chair
Find it just under his elbow as he drinks
Back to the kitchen wench
They are expecting a love potion but would seem prudent to concoct a sleeping drink instead
Go to the shelves at the left of the fireplace and take a copper scale pan from the bottom shelf
Put it on the scale
From the middle shelf you can pick up several herbs
Right click in your inventory to get a description of each one
From left to right menthol unknown leaves cinnamon fleshy leaves anise and spongy leaves
Well that's not much help the recipe calls for crimson red and other colors
We will have to test the herbs to see what color they turn when wet
On the table by the door is a wooden bowl
Take it and use it to scoop water from the cauldron
Don't you just love it
She puts a bowl of boiling water in her pocket
What will they think of next
Anyway go to the scale and put the coin in the right side
Choose an herb crush an ounce of it put it in the weighing pan that is and put it back
Then in inventory put the crushed herb into the water bowl to learn what color it becomes
The recipe says one ounce crimson one of golden and two of ounce and ounce makes green
We find out that there is no green herb but we know that blue and yellow create green thus another yellow and one blue would do the job
Here's the colors Menthol white Unknown yellow Cinnamon red Fleshy light brown Anise blue and Spongy violet
Crushing and adding one ounce at a time it calls for two cinnamon two unknown and one anise
There the water turns clear
Time to feed the boys
They get groggy but do not sleep
Go to the kitchen for a moment and return to find them passed out
Take the key from the blond fellow
You can look at the left hand end of the room if you like but the exit is locked
Go down the cellar stairs to find Brent whining in his cell
I'd whine too if I was counting rats while you are brewing love potions Jeez
Let him out
If you tried the key upstairs you know it's the wrong one
Go left to the big crates
They're heavy for one but the two of you are up to the job
Find the secret exit and proceed
It looks like a maze but don't worry
Just proceed following Brent's voice until Groan


You are seized not to be seen as Melanie for a while
In the MonasteryHalligan wakes up in the monastery
Looking around there is a yoke on the floor no thanks a bed and a great view
Turning away from the view we are greeted by Brother Maglor
He is friendly it seems and informs us that our arrival was expected and that it's our responsibility to save the world


WORLDS
Serstan is the bad guy and all the things Blake warned about are true and we are in the thick of it
We will have the run of the place that is until the day of our execution
Huh
Execution
Nobody said that was part of the deal
Seems we need to find the room with the crystal ball and pronto
The first room on the left Halligan's right is Brother Maglor's
Go in and talk to him as much as possible
Serstan has perfected the ritual and must be stopped
It will take place at Stonehenge only days and six hours from now
We are probably honored guests if you get my drift
The next room is a storehouse for foodstuffs
Mind the rats
Next view down shows three doors
The one on the right has books on a table and the fire's out
The middle door is not accessible and the one up the steps leads to a mysterious room with a huge portal barred and locked
Go back out and around the corner by your room
The first door on the right right on the screen H's left goes outside to the interior courtyard you saw out the window
Go right H's left and visit the blacksmith
Talk to him about everything including his village and unusual things happening
Look around the back of the shop and see the shield with the same symbol wavy lines and an X
We have figured out by now the X is two logs the wavy lines show them burning
Outside look at the other side of the shop and see the chimney blocked by a bird's nest
No wonder the fire doesn't burn
Go back and investigate the other end of the courtyard
There is a garden a drain a rusty pipe further on there are stables hay and a pitchfork a cistern full of water and a valve
I feel a plan coming on but what to do
Time will tell I'm sure
Go back inside
Across the hall is a large double door
Look in and find a large conference table complete with familiar signs again notice the sequence
At the far end is a device like a slide rule
The small door leads into the library
Guess who's been doing her homework
Melanie convinces us that she is doing the right thing and persuades us to keep looking around
Next door is the kitchen
Eeek
Mind the rats
Over on the right sideboard is aniron crucible
Take it Over on the other side of the room past the stove is a table withsome herbs
Take them See the hatch to the dining room
You can open and close it
You can also open and close it from the other side which is obviously the next room
There is someone sitting there but he does not talk to us
The next room is Serstan's
Enter and talk with him You will find you just how imperious he is
He kicks you out
Next room the fire's working but little else to do
Next you will find the candelry Take some candlesand go back to the room with the working fire
Place the crucible on the fire then the candles in the crucible
You have ablock of wax
Go back outside to the garden
Put the herbs on the drain blocking it
Turn the valve on the rusty pipe
Then go all the way back to the cistern and open the valve letting the water flood the garden and drive some earthworms out of the soil
Take the worms
Go to the far side of the Smithy's shop and climb up to the roof
Put the worms on the roof luring the crow away from her nest
Pull down the nest allowing the fire to work properly
Speak to the smith
He is grateful sort of
He might help someday
Go around back of the shop again farther until you find a chopping block and axe Take a chip of woodfrom the block
Go back inside and visit Serstan again
He throws you out
Visit him again and ask to watch
He doesn't care as long as you don't touch anything
Notice the artwork Three of the four pieces that you saw in Sinclair's house
The fourth painting Sinclair had showed the scene of the temples same as the view out your bedroom window
Find the Secret compartment in the wall behind Serstan just to the right of the window Put the piece of wood in there
Now go visit Maglor and ask him for undisturbed access to Serstan's room
That settles it

Grudgingly he will try
Return to Serstan's empty room
Serstan has closed the secret compartment with a block
Must be something valuable in there
You can pull out the block because the little piece of wood prevented its being seated properly
Take out the red chest and place it on the stool
Open the chest take the key andmake an impressionin the wax
Put the key back take the wood chip outof the hole and replace the chest and block
You want the room to appear undisturbed
Go to the Blacksmith and convince him tomake a keyfrom the wax impression
It will take some time so let's visit Melanie and see if she has learned anything
She has but it's not much help
The main reason for seeing her is to allow the smithy enough time to cast the key
Go back and get the key
Make your way to the large doors that are locked and barred
Unlock both padlocks and remove the beam
Enter This would be a nice time to save your game Okay does anyonehate mazesmore than I do
This one's a real doozy
I cannot take credit for solving it
What makes it difficult is the fact that going back the way you seemingly came does not necessarily take you backwards
You can end up at a different location
In fact the path you need to take actually has you stepping into the door you arrived at four times
The shortest path is only ten steps long if you do it correctly
If you have the insanity patience you could map the maze functions and figure it out because each node is coded with a runic symbol
Probably they relate to the way the maze works but I'll leave that up to the more intrepid player to discover
For the quick way through this mess Click Here
Cross the open area and discover a stone wall decorated with relief carvings
Examine them
Turn around and close the wooden door and the eye will open revealing a tunnel
You have found the Crystal ball
Look into it
Huh
Stonehenge but it should be intact not in ruins
Evidently the crystal ball is an Eye into Time
Look around the perimeter of the room
You find two rod and ball devices similar to the one in the conference room
One is whole the other destroyed
Let's go back into the monastery
Maybe we can find Maglor and get some enlightenment
Look in the conference room
He is there next to the Library door
He tells us that those devices arecalendars and that Serstan controls things by adjusting them
We learn that the current date is represented on the calendar in this room
Let's have a look
If this thing is a calendar then the segmented bars must represent weeks days months or whatever the Druid calendar was composed of
The top bar has segments the second the third the fourth and the bottom one
The balls are set from bottom to top
That should be easy enough to remember
Go to the crystal ball room
Don't worry the maze remains solved
Set the calendar to match the one upstairs ignoring the two new rods that Serstan installed at the top
Start from the bottom and set them
Look in the crystal ball now
Apparently the calendar here controls the view in the crystal ball
Stonehenge is in good condition
Now set the calendar for the time of the ritual two days from now so slide the ball on the third rod days from one to three the second one represents day and night so it's already correct and the top rod should be on six for the hours
Need a picture Click Here Now look in the crystal ball again
Oh
Better go find Maglor and tell him what's up
Go to your room he will find you
You talk and Serstan decides to put an end to your antics
Take the bedsheet make a hole in it with the candle go to the window and click on the temple in the distance
Geronimo
The makeshift parachute works remarkably well given the circumstances
Unfortunately Serstan hurls a magic bolt and hits Maglor in the back you land in the stream and Maglor lands in the forest
Go back and find Maglor
He is badly injured and when you convince him you can help he suggests mistletoe
It's nearby at the base of a tree behind some nettles
Use the gloves to part the nettles and grab the mistletoe
Too late
Maglor is gone
Take the gyro top from his pocket and go into the Left Temple The Left TempleInside the entrance is a table with circular scratch marks
Use the top and the cylinder opens
Go in and it turns depositing you in another area
Enter it again and you see a column
Take the flint
Go up the stairs and take the scoop
Into the cylinder twice and see a leather flask
You can't pick it up
Upstairs take the small shovel
Into the roundabout twice and on the column is a bowl of water
Use the scoop to take some
Upstairs is another flint
you have one you don't need two
Two turns and find a bowl of earth
The Earth looks like it's been through the horse
LOL
Use the shovel to take some
Upstairs take the bellows
Into the cylinder again to the leather flask four turns
Use the bellows to draw out the gaseous contents
It's Air by the way
Into the roundabout until you come to the entrance and leave the building
Go to the right temple The Right TempleIn the center of the temple is an altar on which is a key you cannot take
It needs to be released somehow
Look in the individual rooms starting with the one to the left of the entrance H's right proceeding counter clockwise
The first room has a cage like device with some straw in it
On the right side is a padlock
Close up it looks just like the Amulet of Transformation
Do you suppose
Yes the amulet opens the lock
Open the cage use your flint to strike a fire take the torch from the wall above and light the torch
Close the cage
Apply the torch to the grate below the basin to start the flame
Look out the window and see the megalith
Listen It sounds faintly like fire out there too
Go to the next room and see the vessel with the symbol for air
Use your bellows to put air into the chamber
Light the fire underneath and look out the window to see the stone and hear water running
Hmmm Fire and Air can make water
Lightning
Go past the locked door to the next room
The vessel has the symbol for water
Lift the top and pour in the water
Light the flame see the stone out the window and hear the wind blowing
Hmmm Fire and water can make air
Steam
In the last room the vessel has the symbol for earth
Open it and put in the earth sample
Light the fire and see the megalith and again hear the wind blow
Hmmm Fire and Earth can make Air
gases
You see the magic shield around the altar turn off
Go to the altar take the key unlock the blue door and proceed downstairs On the way down you will come across some slits in the wall
They contain stone tiles with the elemental symbols on them
There will be eight tiles in all
Some of them are hard to see as indicated in the photo
As a help whenever there is one tile at a location there is always another
Two sets look like this and two are a different view looking down
In that case the easy to see ones are higher up and the hard ones are just about shoulder height
Gather all eight tiles and head into the chamber below
Take care because of the stairs your orientation is different
The elements are arranged in the same sequence as above but whereas upstairs you entered between fire and earth now you enter between earth and water
Look in one of the rooms
You will see a pedestal and a megalith
The object here is to distribute the tiles so that the pedestal receives a tile corresponding to the starting element as above and the accompanying megaliths will receive a tile representing how the element is changed
So the first one you come to counter clockwise should be earth
Place an earth tile on the pedestal and an air tile in the stone
Then in the next room place fire in both
In the third room use air on the pedestal and water in the megalith
Finally water on the pedestal and air in the stone
The shield drops and you can take the staff from the altar
Serstan comes in with Melanie as hostage
You negotiate with Serstan and insist that he swear on his honour that nothing will happen to either you or Melanie
Then he begins the ritual and sends you through the gate of the worlds to the present
Off to Stonehenge then for it must be time for the ritual at Sinclair's hands
Cruel as it may be there is only one logical way to disrupt the proceedings
Serstan swore that nothing would happen so conscience set aside and for the good of the world

worlds take your hedge clippers and use them on Melanie
She dies Serstan's vow is broken and Sinclair falls victim to his own evil
The neo Druids do not exist
Now are only problem is Melanie
Do we have any way to save her
Did we almost save Maglor
Hopefully a thousand year old sprig of mistletoe will help
Ahhhhh
For a forum on Mystery of the Druids Click Here Just a quick note when I arrived at the final scene and Sinclair started to cut his throat the game crashed
